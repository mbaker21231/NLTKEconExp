      "\n",
      "Not many years had elapsed after the first edition of this work, when it became known\n",
      "to all with whom Mr. Malthus had the opportunity of communicating on the subject,\n",
      "or who were acquainted with his last publications, that his opinions on the subject of\n",
      "value had undergone some change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having formerly assumed, in common with most other Economists, that there was no\n",
      "perfectly accurate and unvarying measure of value, he had proposed a mean between\n",
      "corn and labour, as being the nearest approximation to it, which could be found.\n",
      "\n",
      "But maturer reflection led him to a different view; and he subsequently became\n",
      "convinced that the standard of which he had been in search must necessarily reside in\n",
      "some one unalterable object, which had a fixed and permanent existence; rightly\n",
      "judging, that it would be impossible to establish any satisfactory conclusions\n",
      "respecting the rise or fall in the value of commodities, unless there existed a real test,\n",
      "which could, at all times, be practically referred to.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not, however, till after long meditation, and the most careful consideration of\n",
      "the subject, that he finally adopted the measure proposed by the author of the Inquiry\n",
      "into the Wealth of Nations, and became a convert to the doctrine, that as “Labour was\n",
      "the first price, the original purchase money that was paid for all things,”* the value of\n",
      "every thing must be greater or less in proportion “as it is worth more or less of this\n",
      "original purchase money.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That many eminent writers since the time of Adam Smith, should have rejected this\n",
      "measure, has probably arisen from their having given to the term value, a sense\n",
      "different from that which he gave to it, and which it is usually meant to express.\n",
      "According to their notion of value, it consists in the general power of purchasing,† or\n",
      "expresses the relation which commodities bear to each other, from which it would\n",
      "necessarily follow, that if the cost of producing all things were either increased or\n",
      "diminished, their value would nevertheless remain unaltered, provided they continued\n",
      "to exchange with each other in the same proportion as before; and by the same rule,\n",

      "It is matter of general observation that the lives of literary men, especially of the good\n",
      "and virtuous, are rarely fruitful in that class of incidents which are wont to be most\n",
      "attractive in the public eye. With the minds of such persons, however, it may be far\n",
      "otherwise: of these the march is often varied and eventful; and to describe faithfully\n",
      "their state and condition at the different stages of their being, the steps by which they\n",
      "have advanced, the helps and hindrances they have experienced, and the influences\n",
      "which have most contributed to form or to fix their character, would be a task not less\n",
      "interesting than instructive; but the misfortune is that it is one which can only be\n",
      "performed adequately by the subject himself, and, as great merit is usually\n",
      "accompanied with great modesty, they who are best qualified to execute the office,\n",
      "are generally the least disposed to undertake it. In neither of these respects can Mr.\n",
      "Malthus be considered as an exception: the tenor of his life was one of the most even\n",
      "serene and peaceful that can be well imagined; and such was his diffidence and\n",
      "habitual disregard of self, that he has left nothing upon record intended directly as a\n",
      "memorial of his life, and little else which can be made subservient to such a purpose\n",
      "by others. But this reserve, so becoming and characteristic in himself, would be\n",
      "almost culpable in his friends. They are well aware that such a man could not depart\n",
      "from a scene, in which as an author he had borne so conspicuous a part, without\n",
      "exciting much curiosity respecting the principles and the conduct of his private life;\n",
      "and as they have nothing to communicate but what is honourable to himself and\n",
      "edifying to the public, there is no reason why they should be silent. It happens too,\n",
      "fortunately, that the materials at their disposal are quite sufficient in this respect; for\n",
      "as the recollections of his friends, still fresh and vivid, are fully competent to exhibit\n",
      "his character and manners in his later years, so also his own filial piety, by treasuring\n",
      "up every record of his father, has undesignedly furnished more particulars for the\n",
      "history of his early youth than are usually found in the annals of literary men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor will the task of recording these memorials be an unprofitable one. No one could\n",

      "pleasure from his conversation, and many salutary lessons from the contemplation of\n",
      "his character under the trials he underwent. To review therefore the course of his life\n",
      "is to bring back these influences to the memory, and, impressed as they must be now\n",

      "when the Essay on Population was published, now more than thirty years ago, there\n",
      "were two great dangers threatening the peace of society, with which he had to deal; on\n",
      "the one hand, Mr. Godwin and his followers were striking at the reverence for all\n",
      "social institutions, by holding out delusive visions of perfectibility which could never\n",

      "their naked deformity, the dangers it would always involve, and the sin and misery\n",

      "the necessities it creates, and the fears and hopes it suggests, excites the best energies\n",
      "of mankind into action, overcomes their natural indolence, and gives spirit and\n",
      "perseverance to their most valuable labours. But this view of the subject, however\n",
      "favourable to the argument of Dr. Sumner, was not adapted to the adversary which\n",
      "Mr. Malthus had to encounter. Finally it is necessary to remember, that whatever\n",
      "might have been the author’s view of the evils incident to the principle, temperance,\n",
      "frugality, foresight, and especially self-control—virtues strictly scriptural and\n",
      "evangelical—were the sole remedies recommended by him. Nor can it be said at\n",

      "notwithstanding all the warnings of the “Essay on Population,” the evil it\n",
      "contemplated had lately risen to so great a height as to threaten the most serious\n",
      "mischief to society, and to call for the strongest measures; and we believe, firmly, that\n",

      "partake more of the certainty of the stricter sciences than those of most of the other\n",
      "branches of human knowledge. Yet we should fall into a serious error if we were to\n",
      "suppose that any propositions, the practical results of which depend upon the agency\n",
      "of so variable a being as man, and the qualities of so variable a compound as the soil,\n",
      "can ever admit of the same kinds of proof, or lead to the same certain conclusions, as\n",
      "those which relate to figure and number. There are indeed in political economy great\n",
      "general principles, to which exceptions are of the most rare occurrence, and prominent\n",
      "land-marks which may almost always be depended upon as safe guides; but even\n",
      "these, when examined, will be found to resemble in most particulars the great general\n",
      "rules in morals and politics founded upon the known passions and propensities of\n",
      "human nature: and whether we advert to the qualities of man, or of the earth he is\n",
      "destined to cultivate, we shall be compelled to acknowledge, that the science of\n",
      "political economy bears a nearer resemblance to the science of morals and politics\n",
      "than to that of mathematics.\n",

      "This conclusion, which could hardly fail to be formed merely from a view of the\n",
      "subjects about which political economy is conversant, is further strengthened by the\n",

      "leaving every person, while he adheres to the rules of justice, to pursue his own\n",
      "interest his own way, together with some others: and unquestionably their agreement\n",
      "on these principles affords the strongest presumption of their truth. Yet the differences\n",
      "of the Economists and Adam Smith were not mere differences in theory; they were\n",
      "not different interpretations of the same phenomena, which would have no influence\n",
      "on practice; but they involved such views of the nature and origin of wealth, as, if\n",
      "adopted, would lead, in almost every country, to great practical changes particularly\n",

      "impossible to fix on one not liable to some objection. In a work, however, on a\n",
      "science, the great object of which is, to inquire into the causes which influence the\n",

      "between the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms; yet the advantages of such a\n",
      "classification are universally acknowledged; and no one on account of a difficulty, in\n",

      "This definition obviously includes every thing whether material or intellectual,\n",

      "from morals, from political and civil liberty, from oratory, from instructive and\n",
      "agreeable conversation, from music, dancing, acting, and all personal qualities and\n",

      "that species of labour, which directly produces what they call wealth, according to\n",
      "their several views of its nature and origin. The Economists therefore, who confine\n",
      "wealth to the products of the soil, mean by productive labour, that labour alone which\n",

      "unproductive labour, used by Adam Smith to express all other kinds of labour, has\n",
      "been frequently so interpreted, and has formed in consequence the great objection to\n",
      "his classification. To remove this objection to a classification in other respects\n",
      "sufficiently correct for practical purposes, and beyond comparison more useful in\n",
      "explaining the causes of the wealth of nations, than any other which has hitherto been\n",

      "unproductive labour.\n",

      "Labour may then be distinguished into two kinds, productive labour, and personal\n",
      "services, meaning by productive labour that labour which is so directly productive of\n",

      "On The Different Sorts Of Value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most writers in treating of value, have considered it as having two different meanings;\n",
      "one, value in use, and the other, value in exchange. We are not, however, much in the\n",
      "habit of applying the term in the first of these two senses. We do not often hear of the\n",
      "value of air and water, although they are bodies in the highest degree useful, and\n",
      "indeed essentially necessary to the life and happiness of human beings. Yet it may be\n",
      "admitted that the term, taken perhaps in a metaphorical, rather than in a literal sense,\n",
      "may imply, and is sometimes used to imply, whatever is in any way beneficial to us,\n",
      "and in this sense may apply without impropriety to an abundant spring of water, or to\n",
      "a fine air, although no question could arise respecting their value in exchange.\n",
      "\n",
      "As this meaning therefore of the word value has already been admitted by many\n",
      "writers into the vocabulary of political economy, it may not be worth while to reject\n",
      "it; and it need only be observed, that as the application of the word value in this way,\n",
      "is very much less frequent than in the other, it should never appear alone, but should\n",
      "always be marked by the addition in use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Value in exchange is the relation of one object to some other or others in exchange.\n",
      "To determine this relation accurately in any particular case, an actual exchange must\n",
      "take place; and every exchange must imply not only the power and will to give some\n",
      "object in exchange for one more wanted, but a reciprocal desire in the party\n",
      "possessing the commodity wanted, for the commodity or the labour proposed to be\n",
      "exchanged for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When this reciprocal desire exists, the rate at which the exchange is made, or the\n",
      "portion of one object which is given for an assigned portion of the other, will depend\n",
      "upon the estimation in which each is held by the parties concerned, founded on the\n",
      "desire to possess, and the difficulty of procuring possession of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Owing to the necessary difference of the desires of individuals, and their powers of\n",
      "producing, or purchasing, it is probable that the contracts thus made were, in the first\n",
      "instances, very different from each other. Among some individuals it might be agreed\n",
      "to give six pounds of bread for a pound of venison, and among others only two. But\n",
      "the man who was ready and willing to give six pounds of bread for a pound of\n",
      "venison, if he heard of a person at a little distance who would take two pounds for the\n",

      "After a certain time it might be expected that a sort of average would be formed,\n",

      "as is very happily described by Turgot, a current relative value of all commodities in\n",
      "frequent use would be established.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be known not only that a pound of venison was worth four pounds of bread,\n",
      "but that it was also worth perhaps a pound of cheese, a quarter of a peck of wheat, a\n",
      "quart of wine, a certain portion of leather, &c. &c. each of an average quality, the\n",
      "estimation in which each of these several objects was ordinarily held by the society,\n",

      "difficulty of procuring possession of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each commodity would in this way measure the relative values of all others, and\n",
      "would in its turn be measured by any one of them. Each commodity would also be a\n",
      "representative of value. The possessor of a quart of wine might consider himself in\n",
      "possession of a value equal to four pounds of bread, a pound of cheese, a certain\n",
      "portion of leather, &c. &c. and thus each commodity would, with more or less\n",

      "tolerable degree of accuracy, a great difficulty in making exchanges, and in the\n",
      "determination of relative value would be constantly recurring from the want of a\n",
      "reciprocal demand. The possessor of venison might want bread, but the possessor of\n",
      "bread to whom he applied might not want venison, or not that quantity of it which the\n",

      "The terms demand and supply are so familiar to the ear of every reader, and their\n",
      "application in single instances so fully understood, that in the slight use which has\n",
      "hitherto been made of them, it has not been thought necessary to interrupt the course\n",
      "of the reasoning by definitions and explanations. These terms, however, though in\n",
      "constant use, are by no means applied with precision. And before we proceed further,\n",
      "it may be advisable to clear this part of the ground as much as possible, that we may\n",
      "be certain of the footing on which we stand. This will appear to be the more\n",
      "necessary, as it must be allowed that of all the principles of political economy, there is\n",
      "none which bears so large a share in the phenomena which come under its\n",
      "consideration as the principle of supply and demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been already stated, that exchangeable value is the relation of one object to\n",
      "some other or others in exchange. And when, by the introduction of a medium of\n",
      "exchange and measure of value, a distinction has been made between buyers and\n",
      "sellers, the demand for any sort of commodities may be defined to be, the will of\n",
      "persons to purchase them, combined with their general means of purchasing; and\n",
      "supply, the quantity of the commodities for sale, combined with the desire to sell\n",
      "them.*\n",
      "\n",
      "It is further evident, that when the use of the precious metals, as a medium of\n",
      "exchange and measure of value, has become general, and during those periods when\n",
      "their value is considered as remaining the same, the demand will be represented and\n",
      "measured by the sacrifice in money which the demanders are willing and able to make\n",
      "in order to satisfy their wants.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this state of things, the value of commodities in money or their prices are\n",
      "determined by the demand for them, compared with the supply of them. And this law\n",
      "appears to be so general, that probably not a single instance of a change of price can\n",
      "be found, which may not be satisfactorily traced to some previous change in the state\n",
      "of the demand or supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "In examining the truth of this position, we must constantly bear in mind the terms in\n",
      "which it is expressed; and recollect, that when prices are said to be determined by\n",
      "demand and supply, it is not meant that they are determined either by the demand\n",
      "alone, or by the supply alone, but by their relation to each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how is this relation to be determined? It has sometimes been said, that demand is\n",
      "always equal to supply; because no supply of any commodity can take place for which\n",
      "there is not a demand, which will take off all that is offered. In one sense of the terms\n",
      "in which demand and supply have been used, this position may be granted. The actual\n",

      "increase in proportion to the fall of price occasioned by the desire to sell, and the\n",

      "demand should not exist in such a degree among a sufficient number of these two\n",
      "thousand demanders, as to take off the whole of the commodity produced at an\n",
      "increased price. At the same time, if we could suppose it possible, that the wills and\n",
      "means of the demanders, or the intensity of their demand would not admit of increase,\n",
      "it is quite certain that however the matter might be settled among the contending\n",

      "if they really would not or could not do this, the price could not rise.\n",

      "supply remained the same, it would be a proof that all the purchasers were in this\n",
      "state, but that the expression of this intensity of demand had not before been rendered\n",
      "necessary on account of the facility with which the article had been previously\n",
      "produced, and the competition of the sellers. In the latter case there would be exactly\n",

      "Mr. Ricardo, in his chapter “On the influence of demand and supply on prices,”\n",

      "additional quantity of it be purchased or consumed.” But it is obvious, as I have\n",
      "before remarked, that it is not in the sense of mere extent of consumption that demand\n",
      "raises prices, because it is almost always when prices are the lowest, that the extent of\n",
      "demand and consumption is the greatest. This, therefore, cannot be the meaning\n",
      "hitherto attached to the term demand, when it is said to raise prices. Mr. Ricardo,\n",
      "however, subsequently quotes Lord Lauderdale’s statements respecting value, and\n",
      "allows them to be true, as applied to monopolized commodities, and to the market\n",
      "prices of all other commodities, for a limited period. He would allow, therefore, that a\n",
      "deficiency in the usual quantity of an article in a market would occasion a greater\n",
      "demand for it compared with the supply, and raise its price, although in this case less\n",
      "than usual of the article must be purchased by the consumers. Demand in this sense is\n",
      "obviously quite different from the sense in which Mr. Ricardo had before used the\n",
      "term. The one is a demand in regard to extent, the increase of which implies a greater\n",
      "quantity of the commodity purchased; the other is demand in regard to intensity, the\n",
      "increase of which implies the will and power to make a greater sacrifice in order to\n",
      "obtain the object wanted. It is in this latter sense, I think, that the term is most\n",
      "frequently applied; at any rate, it is in this latter sense alone that demand raises\n",

      "to extent, should raise prices, unaccompanied by a will and power on the part of the\n",

      "Of The Cost Of Production As Affected By The Demand And\n",
      "Supply, And On The Mode Of Representing Demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be said, perhaps, that even according to the view given of demand and supply\n",
      "in the preceding section, the permanent prices of the great mass of commodities will\n",
      "be determined by the ordinary cost of their production. This is unquestionably true, if\n",
      "we include all the component parts of price stated by Adam Smith. Yet, still it is true,\n",
      "that in all transactions of bargain and sale, there is a principle in constant operation,\n",
      "which can determine, and does actually determine, the prices of commodities,\n",
      "independently of any considerations of cost, or of the ordinary wages, profits, and rent\n",
      "expended in their production. And this is found to operate, not only permanently upon\n",
      "that class of commodities which may be considered as monopolies, but temporarily\n",
      "and immediately upon all commodities, and strikingly and preeminently so upon all\n",
      "sorts of raw produce.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has never been a matter of doubt, that the principle of demand and supply\n",
      "determines exclusively, and very regularly and accurately, the prices of monopolized\n",
      "commodities, without reference to the ordinary cost of their production; and our daily\n",
      "and uniform experience shows us that the prices of raw products, particularly those\n",
      "which are most affected by the seasons, are at the moment of their sale determined\n",
      "always by the higgling of the market, and differ widely in different years, and at\n",
      "different times, while the outgoings required to produce them, may have been very\n",
      "nearly the same, and the general rate of profits has not varied.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard, therefore, to a class of commodities of the greatest extent, it is\n",
      "acknowledged that the existing market prices are, at the moment they are fixed,\n",
      "determined upon a principle distinct from the cost of production, and that these prices\n",
      "are in reality almost always different from what they would have been, if this cost had\n",
      "exclusively regulated them.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is indeed another class of commodities, such as manufactures, particularly\n",
      "those in which the raw material is cheap, where the existing market prices much more\n",
      "frequently coincide with the costs of production, and may appear therefore to be\n",
      "exclusively determined by them. Even here, however, our familiar experience shews\n",
      "us, that any alteration in the proportion of the demand to the supply quite overcomes\n",
      "for a time the influence of these costs; and further, when we come to examine the\n",
      "subject more closely, we find that the cost of production itself only influences the\n",
      "prices of these commodities, as the payment of this cost is the necessary condition of\n",
      "their continued supply in proportion to the extent of the effectual demand for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if this be true, it follows that the great law of demand and supply is called into\n",

      "It has been shown that no change can take place in the market prices of commodities,\n",
      "without some previous change in the relation of the demand to the supply; and the\n",
      "question is, whether the same position is true in reference to natural prices? This\n",
      "question must of course be determined by attending carefully to the nature of the\n",
      "change which an alteration in the cost of production occasions in the state of the\n",
      "demand and supply, and particularly to the specific and immediate cause by which the\n",
      "change of price which takes place is effected.\n",
      "\n",
      "We all allow that when the cost of production diminishes, a fall of price is almost\n",
      "universally the consequence; but what is it, specifically, which forces down the price\n",

      "\n",
      "We all allow that when the cost of production increases, the prices of commodities\n",
      "rise. But what is it specifically which forces up the price? It has been shown that it is\n",
      "an actual or contingent failure of supply. Remove these actual or contingent variations\n",
      "of the supply; that is, let the extent of the supply remain exactly the same, without\n",
      "excess or failure, whether the cost of production rises or falls; and there is not the\n",
      "slightest ground for supposing that any variation of price would take place.\n",
      "\n",
      "If, for instance, all the commodities which are produced in this country, whether\n",
      "agricultural or manufactured, could be produced during the next ten years without\n",
      "labour, but could only be supplied exactly in the same quantities as they would be in\n",
      "the actual state of things; then, supposing the wills and means of the purchasers to\n",
      "remain the same, there cannot be a doubt that all prices would also remain the same.\n",
      "But if this be allowed, it follows that the relation of the supply to the demand is the\n",
      "dominant principle in the determination of prices whether market or natural, and that\n",
      "the cost of production can do nothing but in subordination to it, that is, merely as it\n",
      "affects the ordinary relation which the supply bears to the demand.\n",

      "It is not, however, necessary to resort to imaginary cases in order to fortify this\n",

      "In the well known instance noticed by Adam Smith of the insufficient pay of curates,\n",
      "notwithstanding all the efforts of the legislature to raise it, a striking proof is afforded\n",
      "that the permanent price of an article is determined by the demand and supply, and not\n",
      "by the cost of production. The real cost of the education would in this case be more\n",
      "likely to be increased than diminished by the subscriptions of benefactors; but a large\n",
      "part of it being paid by these benefactors, and not by the individuals themselves, it\n",

      "obtained without such wages, the real costs of supplying labour no longer regulate the\n",
      "ordinary wages of independent labour.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, in every kind of bounty upon production, the same effects must necessarily\n",

      "But the most striking instance which can well be conceived to show that the cost of\n",
      "production only influences the prices of commodities, as it influences their supply\n",
      "compared with the demand, is continually before our eyes in the artificial value which\n",
      "is given to bank-notes by limiting their amount. Mr. Ricardo’s admirable and efficient\n",
      "plan for this purpose proceeded upon the just principle, that if you can limit the supply\n",
      "of notes, so that they shall not exceed the quantity of gold which would have\n",
      "circulated if the currency had been metallic, you will keep the notes always of the\n",
      "same value as gold. And I am confident he would have allowed, that if this limitation\n",
      "could be completely effected without the paper being exchangeable for gold, the value\n",
      "of the notes would not be altered, while the same demand for a circulating medium\n",
      "continued. But if an article which costs comparatively nothing, though it performs the\n",
      "most important function of gold, can be kept to the value of gold, by being supplied in\n",
      "the same quantity; it is the clearest of all possible proofs that the value of gold itself\n",
      "no further depends upon the cost of its production, than as this cost influences the\n",
      "supply compared with the demand: and that if the cost were to cease, provided the\n",
      "supply were not increased compared with the demand, the value of gold in this\n",
      "country would still remain the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "It does not, however, in any degree follow from what has been said, that the costs of\n",
      "production have not a most powerful effect upon prices. But the true way of\n",
      "considering these costs is as the necessary condition of the supply of the objects\n",

      "\n",
      "Although at the time of the actual purchase of a commodity, no circumstance affects it\n",

      "of these objects must be regulated—First, by the quantity, skill, and direction of this\n",

      "on account of their rarity, and the consequent rarity of the effects produced by them.\n",
      "In all these cases the remuneration will be regulated, not by the intrinsic qualities, or\n",
      "utility of the commodities produced, but by the state of the demand for them,\n",
      "compared with the supply; and of course by the demand and supply of the sort of\n",
      "labour which produced them. If the commodities have been produced by manual\n",
      "labour exclusively, aided at least only by the unappropriated bounties of nature, and\n",
      "brought to market immediately, the whole remuneration will of course belong to the\n",

      "to the labourer, by the previous accumulation of objects which facilitate future\n",
      "production, should be so remunerated as to continue the application of this assistance\n",
      "to the production of the commodities required. If by means of certain advances to the\n",
      "labourer of machinery, food and materials previously collected, he can execute eight\n",

      "do not depend upon their intrinsic utility, but upon the supply and demand. The\n",
      "increased powers of labour would naturally produce an increased supply of\n",
      "commodities; their prices would consequently fall, and the remuneration for the\n",
      "capital advanced would soon be reduced to what was necessary in the existing state of\n",
      "the society, to encourage the application of such capital to the production in question,\n",
      "in the quantity required by the effectual demand. With regard to the labourers\n",

      "if they had worked unassisted, their remuneration in money would be nearly the same\n",
      "as before, and would depend entirely upon the kind of labour employed, estimated in\n",
      "the usual way, by the money demand compared with the supply. But the price of\n",
      "labour so determined would, under the influence of good machinery, give the labourer\n",

      "\n",
      "In the two last sections, the causes which affect and determine the exchangeable\n",
      "values of commodities have been investigated; and these appear to consist of every\n",
      "circumstance which contributes in any degree to enhance the difficulty of obtaining\n",
      "them: such as, the necessity of paying the wages of a certain quantity of labour,\n",
      "without which the commodity cannot be produced, the necessity of certain advances\n",
      "of other capital, which no one will continue to make without the ordinary\n",
      "remuneration in the shape of profits, and the frequent necessity of further payments\n",
      "owing to rents, tithes, taxes, natural and artificial monopolies, and temporary\n",
      "deficiencies of supply, arising from accident, or the state of the seasons. These are all\n",
      "sources of difficulty, which, in proportion to the degree in which they prevail, must\n",
      "raise the exchangeable value of commodities arising from intrinsic causes; and it has\n",
      "further appeared, that the result of all these causes of value is expressed in the state of\n",
      "the supply compared with the intensity of the demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "We come now to inquire more particularly into the measures of value—an inquiry\n",
      "obviously not identical with an inquiry into the causes of value, as it is only in a very\n",
      "few cases that they can properly be represented by the same object.*\n",
      "\n",
      "A measure of value is wanted for two most important purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, to measure easily and conveniently the relative values of all commodities,\n",
      "compared one with another, and to enable all dealers to estimate the profits which\n",
      "they make upon their sales. This purpose is completely answered by money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, to measure the difficulty with which a commodity is obtained, including all\n",
      "the conditions of its supply; and when two or more commodities have in the course of\n",
      "time altered in their exchangeable relations to each other, to enable us to ascertain in\n",
      "which, and to what extent in each, the change has taken place.* This is most important\n",
      "information, particularly in reference to commodities of the same country, at different\n",
      "times; but it is evident, that as money, in periods of some length, is liable to alter\n",
      "greatly in its exchangeable value, arising from intrinsic causes, it is impossible that,\n",
      "applied as a measure, it can give the information required.\n",
      "\n",
      "It remains, therefore, to be considered whether any other object can perform the\n",
      "functions of a general measure of value, and answer the purposes above described.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adam Smith, in his chapter† on the real and nominal price of commodities, in which\n",
      "he considers labour as a universal and accurate measure of value, has introduced some\n",
      "confusion into his inquiry, by not adhering strictly to the same mode of applying the\n",

      "Sometimes he speaks of the value of a commodity as being measured by the quantity\n",
      "of labour which its production has cost, and sometimes by the quantity of labour\n",
      "which it will command in exchange.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is in the latter sense, however, in which he applies it much the most frequently, and\n",
      "on which he evidently lays the chief stress. “The value of any commodity,” he says,\n",
      "“to the person who possesses it, and who means not to use or consume it himself, but\n",
      "to exchange it for other commodities, is equal to the quantity of labour which it\n",
      "enables him to purchase or command. Labour, therefore, is the real measure of the\n",
      "exchangeable value of all commodities.”* Other expressions in the same chapter\n",
      "apply labour as a measure of value in the same way;† and on another occasion, in his\n",
      "digression on the value of silver during the four last centuries, he takes an opportunity\n",
      "to say, “Labour, be it remembered, and not any commodity, or mass of commodities,\n",
      "is the sole measure of the value of silver, and of all other commodities.”‡\n",
      "\n",
      "These passages may be said to determine the prevailing sense in which he considers\n",
      "labour as a general measure of exchangeable value. It would not then be worth while\n",
      "to inquire how far labour may be considered as a measure of value, when applied in\n",
      "the way which Adam Smith has practically rejected in reference to the more advanced\n",
      "stages of society, if this mode of applying it had not been adopted by some\n",

      "the question embraces not merely the propriety of a definition, but the truth of a\n",
      "proposition. It is not merely what should be the definition and the measure of value in\n",
      "exchange, but a question of fact, whether the labour worked up in commodities either\n",
      "determines or measures the rate at which they exchange with each other; and in no\n",
      "stage of society with which we are acquainted does it do this. At a very early period\n",
      "profits will be found to enter largely into the question of exchangeable value as a\n",
      "necessary condition of the supply. To make even a bow and arrow, it is obviously\n",
      "necessary that the wood and reed should be properly dried and seasoned, and the time\n",
      "which these materials require to be kept by the workman before his work is\n",
      "completed, introduces at once a new element into the computation of value. The\n",
      "varying quickness of the returns is likewise an entirely new element, which has\n",
      "nothing to do with the quantity of labour employed upon the capital; and yet in every\n",

      "to the quantity of labour which had been actually employed upon them, and on the\n",
      "capital necessary to their production. On this account it is not improbable that a canoe\n",

      "successive deer always came in within a few days after it had been advanced, while\n",
      "the returns for the labour expended upon the canoe were delayed probably beyond the\n",

      "difference of exchangeable value in different commodities, which had cost in their\n",
      "production and in the production of the necessary capital the same quantity of labour,\n",
      "would be very great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Ricardo, speaking of the different implements which might be necessary, in an\n",
      "early stage of society, to kill the beaver and the deer, says,* that those who furnished\n",
      "these capitals might, under different circumstances, “have a half, a fourth, or an eighth\n",
      "of the produce obtained, the remainder being paid as wages to those who furnished\n",
      "the labour; yet this division could not affect the relative value of these commodities,\n",
      "since, whether the profits of capital were greater or less, whether they were 50, 20, or\n",
      "10 per cent. or whether the wages of labour were high or low, they would operate\n",
      "equally on both employments.” But it is quite obvious from what has been said, that if\n",
      "for the employment of killing a deer, we substitute the employment of making a\n",
      "canoe, which would not be completed in less than a year, or perhaps two, and suppose\n",
      "what is here supposed with great probability, that profits might be 50 per cent., the\n",
      "difference between the value of such a product, and the value of a deer, which, on\n",
      "account of its being sold almost the next day, could hardly be affected by profits,\n",
      "would, in reference to the same quantity of labour employed upon each, be as much as\n",
      "50 per cent. Consequently, in the early stages of society, the relative values of\n",

      "expected, some others. The profits of capital, indeed, are not so high, and\n",
      "consequently the slowness or quickness of the returns will not, as far as the rate of\n",
      "profits is concerned, produce the same proportionate difference of prices; but to make\n",
      "up for this, the difference in the quantity of fixed capital employed is prodigious, and\n",
      "scarcely the same in any two commodities, and the difference in the returns of capital\n",

      "The proposition of Mr. Ricardo, which states that a rise in the price of labour lowers\n",
      "the price of a large class of commodities, has undoubtedly a very paradoxical air; but\n",
      "it is, nevertheless, true, and the appearance of paradox would vanish, if it were stated\n",
      "more naturally and correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Ricardo has allowed, that the effect he contemplated and attributed to a rise in the\n",
      "wages of labour is produced by a fall of profits, which he considers as the same\n",
      "thing;* and undoubtedly no one could have thought the proposition paradoxical, or\n",
      "even in the slightest degree improbable, if he had stated that a fall of profits would\n",
      "occasion a fall of price in those commodities, where, from the quantity of fixed capital\n",
      "employed, the profits of that capital had before formed the principal ingredient in the\n",
      "cost of production. But this is what he has in substance said. In a particular case which\n",
      "he has taken to illustrate his proposition, he supposes the application of a very durable\n",
      "machine worth £20,000, which requires very little labour either to work it, or keep it\n",
      "in constant repair; and, consequently, the price of the yearly produce of this machine\n",
      "would be composed almost entirely of the ordinary profits of the £20,000 which it had\n",
      "cost.* Now it is quite certain, that if, from any cause whatever, the ordinary profits of\n",
      "stock should fall, the price of the commodity so produced would fall nearly in\n",
      "proportion. A fall of profits from 20 to 10 per cent. would reduce its price nearly one\n",
      "half.† This is sufficiently obvious. But the effects arising from an opposite\n",
      "supposition were not at first considered, and the general result was overlooked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The state of the case, in a general view of it, seems to be this. There is a very large\n",
      "class of commodities, in the production of which a great quantity of fixed capital is\n",
      "used, and a long time elapses before the returns of the capital, whether fixed or\n",
      "circulating, come in. In such commodities, the proportion which the capital bears to\n",
      "the quantity of labour which it yearly employs, is in various degrees very\n",
      "considerable: and, in all these cases, it is natural to suppose that the fall of price,\n",
      "arising from the fall of profits, should in various degrees more than counterbalance\n",
      "the rise of price, which would naturally be occasioned by a rise in the price of labour.\n",
      "Consequently, on the supposition of a rise in the price of labour, and a fall in the rate\n",
      "of profits, all these commodities will, in various degrees, naturally fall in price.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, there is a large class of commodities, where, from the absence of\n",
      "fixed capital, and the rapidity of the returns of the circulating capital, the proportion\n",
      "which the capital bears to the quantity of labour it employs is very small. A capital of\n",
      "a hundred pounds, which was returned every week, could employ as much labour\n",
      "annually as £2,600, the returns of which came in only at the end of the year; and if the\n",
      "capital were returned nearly every day, as it is practically in some few cases, the\n",
      "advance of little more than the wages of a man for a single day might pay above three\n",
      "hundred days’ labour in the course of a year. Now it is quite evident, that out of the\n",
      "profits of these trifling capitals, it would not only be absolutely impossible to take a\n",
      "rise in the price of labour of 7 per cent., but it would be impossible to take a rise of ½\n",
      "per cent. On the first supposition, a rise of only ½ per cent. would, if the price of the\n",
      "produce continued the same, absorb more than all the profits of the £100; and, in the\n",
      "other case, much more than all the capital advanced. If, therefore, the prices of\n",

      "frequently applied by Adam Smith, that is, when the value of an object is estimated by\n",
      "the quantity of labour of a given description which it can command, it will appear to\n",

      "It is universally allowed that in the same place, and within moderately short periods of\n",

      "\n",
      "It is obvious, for instance, that in the same place, and at the same time, the different\n",
      "quantities of day labour which different commodities can command, will be exactly in\n",
      "proportion to their relative values in exchange; and if any two of them will purchase\n",
      "the same quantity of labour of the same description, they will invariably exchange\n",
      "with each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "The merchant might safely regulate his dealings, and estimate his commercial profits\n",
      "by the excess of the quantity of labour which his imports would command, compared\n",
      "with his exports. Whether the value of the commodity had arisen principally from the\n",
      "limitation of its supply, occasioned by a strict or partial monopoly; whether it had\n",
      "arisen principally from the scarcity of the raw material, the peculiar sort of labour\n",
      "required in its construction, or from unusually high profits; whether its value had been\n",
      "increased by an increased cost of production, or diminished by the application of\n",

      "permanent or temporary causes—in all cases and under all circumstances, the quantity\n",
      "of labour which it will command, or what comes to the same thing, the quantity of\n",
      "labour’s worth which people will give to obtain it, will be a very exact measure of its\n",

      "\n",
      "One of the most important reasons why practically money makes a much better\n",

      "conditions of their continued supply, if they are in an ordinary state, and the supply\n",
      "compared with the demand in whatever state they may be, which will include of\n",

      "may have operated upon them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consequently money, under these circumstances, that is, while its relation to labour is\n",
      "known and remains constant, is a measure both of relative and intrinsic value in\n",
      "exchange.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if the only cause which prevents money from being such a measure is, that its\n",
      "relation to labour is not constant, it would appear, that as the labour which a\n",
      "commodity will command is necessarily a measure of relative value like money, the\n",
      "substitution of labour so applied instead of money will give the measure we want.\n",

      "purchasing, a measure which it is impossible practically to apply with any approach\n",

      "\n",
      "The rent of land may be defined to be that portion of the value of the whole produce\n",
      "which remains to the owner of the land, after all the outgoings belonging to its\n",
      "cultivation, of whatever kind, have been paid, including the profits of the capital\n",
      "employed, estimated according to the usual and ordinary rate of the profits of\n",
      "agricultural capital at the time being.\n",
      "\n",
      "It sometimes happens that, from accidental and temporary circumstances, the farmer\n",
      "pays more, or less, than this; but this is the point towards which the actual rents paid\n",
      "are constantly gravitating, and which is therefore always referred to when the term is\n",
      "used in a general sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rent then being the excess of the value of the whole produce, or if estimated in\n",
      "money, the excess of the price of the whole produce, above what is necessary to pay\n",
      "the wages of the labour and the profits of the capital employed in cultivation, the first\n",
      "object which presents itself for inquiry, is, the cause or causes of this excess of price.\n",
      "\n",
      "After very careful and repeated revisions of the subject, I do not find myself able to\n",
      "agree entirely in the view taken of it, either by Adam Smith, or the Economists of the\n",
      "school of M. Quesnay; and still less, by some more modern writers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost all these writers appear to me to consider rent as too nearly resembling, in its\n",
      "nature, and the laws by which it is governed, that excess of price above the cost of\n",
      "production, which is the characteristic of a common monopoly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adam Smith, though in some parts of the eleventh chapter of his first book he\n",
      "contemplates rent quite in its true light,* and has interspersed through his work more\n",
      "just observations on the subject than any other writer, has not explained the most\n",
      "essential cause of the ordinary excess of the price of raw produce above its cost of\n",
      "production with sufficient distinctness, though he often touches on it; and by applying\n",
      "occasionally the term monopoly to the rent of land, without stopping to mark its more\n",
      "radical peculiarities, he leaves the reader without a definite impression of the real\n",

      "in common monopolized commodities.\n",
      "\n",

      "in their doctrines has produced little effect. Their great practical conclusion, namely,\n",
      "the propriety of taxing exclusively the neat rents of the landlords, evidently depends\n",

      "M. Say, in his valuable Treatise on Political Economy, in which he has explained with\n",

      "different natural agents which, as well as the land, co-operate with the labours of man,\n",

      "obvious reasons, property in land is necessary, yet he evidently considers rent as\n",
      "almost exclusively owing to such appropriation, and to external demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the excellent work of M. de Sismondi, De la Richesse Commerciale, he says, in a\n",
      "note on the subject of rent: “Cette partie de la rente foncière est celle que les\n",
      "Economistes ont décorée du nom du produit net, comme étant le seul fruit du travail\n",

      "shall only add, that in a very respectable edition of the Wealth of Nations, published\n",
      "by Mr. Buchanan, of Edinburgh, the idea of monopoly is pushed still farther. And,\n",
      "while former writers, though they considered rent as governed entirely by the laws of\n",
      "monopoly, were still of opinion that this monopoly in the case of land was necessary\n",

      "plainly arises from the high price of its produce, which, however advantageous to the\n",
      "landlord who receives it, is surely no advantage to the consumer who pays it. Were\n",
      "the produce of agriculture to be sold for a lower price, the same neat surplus would\n",
      "not remain, after defraying the expenses of cultivation; but agriculture would be still\n",

      "who has the produce of agriculture to sell, diminishes, in the same proportion, the\n",

      "Of The Causes Which Tend To Lower Rents.\n",
      "\n",
      "The causes which lead to a fall of rents are, as may be expected, exactly of an\n",
      "opposite description to those which lead to a rise: namely, diminished capital,\n",
      "diminished population, an operose system of cultivation, and a falling price of raw\n",
      "produce from deficiency of demand. They are almost always* indications of poverty\n",
      "and decline, and are necessarily connected with the throwing of inferior land out of\n",
      "cultivation, and the continued deterioration of the land of a superior quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The necessary effects of a diminished capital and diminished population in lowering\n",
      "rents, are too obvious to require explanation; nor is it less clear that an operose and\n",
      "bad system of cultivation might prevent the formation of rents, even on fertile land, by\n",
      "checking the progress of population and demand beyond what could be supplied from\n",
      "the very richest qualities of soil. I will only therefore advert to the fourth cause here\n",
      "noticed.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have seen that a rise in the price of corn, terminating in a diminished value of the\n",
      "precious metals, would give a considerable stimulus to cultivation for a certain time,\n",
      "and some facilities permanently, and might occasion a considerable and permanent\n",
      "rise of rents. And this case was exemplified by what happened in this country during\n",
      "the period from 1794 to 1814.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be stated in like manner, that a fall in the price of corn terminating in a rise in\n",
      "the value of money, must, upon the same principles, tend to throw land out of\n",
      "cultivation and lower rents. And this may be exemplified by what happened in this\n",
      "country at the conclusion of the war. The fall in the price of corn at that period\n",
      "necessarily disabled the cultivators from employing the same quantity of labour on\n",
      "their land. Many labourers, therefore, were unavoidably thrown out of employment;\n",
      "and, as the land could not be cultivated in the same way, without the same number of\n",
      "hands, some of the worst soils were no longer worked, much agricultural capital was\n",
      "destroyed, and rents universally fell; while this great failure in the power of\n",
      "purchasing, among all those who either rented or possessed land, naturally occasioned\n",
      "a general stagnation in all other trades. But the fall in the money price of labour* from\n",
      "the competition of the labourers, and the poverty of the cultivators; together with the\n",
      "fall of rents, from the want of power to pay the former rents, would tend to restore the\n",
      "former relations of produce, wages, and rents to each other, though they would all be\n",
      "lower in price than they were before. The land which had been thrown out of tillage\n",
      "might then again be cultivated with advantage; but in the progress from the lower to\n",
      "the higher value of money, a period would have elapsed of diminished produce,\n",
      "diminished capital, and diminished rents. The country would recommence a\n",
      "progressive movement from an impoverished state; and, owing to a fall in the value of\n",

      "It has appeared that, in the progress of cultivation and of increasing rents, it is not\n",

      "cultivation might increase, although either the profits of stock or the wages of labour\n",
      "might be higher, instead of lower.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the same manner, when the produce of a country is declining from a diminution of\n",
      "demand, and rents in consequence falling, it is not necessary that all the causes which\n",
      "tend to lower rents should be in action. In the natural progress of such a decline, the\n",
      "profits of stock must be low; because it is specifically the want of adequate returns\n",
      "which occasions this decline. After some capital has been destroyed, money wages\n",
      "will fall; but the low price of raw produce may more than counterbalance the low\n",
      "money wages of labour, and prevent the profitable cultivation of land where much\n",
      "capital is required.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has appeared also, that in the progress of cultivation, and of increasing rents, if not\n",
      "accompanied by very decided agricultural improvements, rent, though greater in\n",
      "positive amount, often bears a less proportion to the quantity of capital employed\n",
      "upon the land, and the quantity of produce derived from it. According to the same\n",
      "principle, when produce diminishes and rents fall, though the amount of rent will be\n",
      "less, the proportion which it bears to capital and produce may be greater. And as, in\n",
      "the former case, the diminished proportion of rent was owing to the necessity of\n",
      "yearly taking fresh land, consisting of rough pasture and wood, into cultivation, and\n",
      "proceeding in the improvement of old land, when it would return only the common\n",
      "profits of stock, with little or no rent; so, in the latter case, the higher proportion of\n",
      "rent is owing to the discouragement of a great expenditure in agriculture, and the\n",
      "necessity of employing the reduced capital of the country in the exclusive cultivation\n",
      "of the richest lands, and leaving the remainder to yield what rent can be got for them\n",
      "in natural pasture, which, though small, will bear a large proportion to the labour and\n",
      "other capital employed. In proportion, therefore, as the relative state of prices is such\n",
      "as to occasion a progressive fall of rents, more and more land will be gradually\n",
      "thrown out of cultivation, the remainder will be worse cultivated, and the diminution\n",
      "of produce will generally proceed still faster than the diminution of rents.*\n",

      "before Parliament; and have been particularly remarkable in Ireland, where the\n",
      "imprudence of the landlords in this respect, combined perhaps with some real\n",
      "difficulty in finding substantial tenants, has aggravated the discontents of the country,\n",

      "On The Strict And Necessary Connection Of The Interests Of\n",
      "The Landlord And Of The State.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been stated by Adam Smith, that the interest of the landholder is “strictly and\n",
      "inseparably connected with the general interest of the society:” and that whatever\n",
      "either promotes or obstructs the one, necessarily promotes or obstructs the other.* The\n",
      "theory of rent, as laid down in the present chapter, seems strongly to confirm this\n",
      "statement. If under any given natural resources in land, the main causes which\n",
      "conduce to the interest of the landholder are increase of capital, increase of\n",
      "population, improvements in agriculture, and an increasing demand for raw produce\n",
      "occasioned by the prosperity of commerce, it seems scarcely possible to consider the\n",
      "interests of the landlord as separated from the general interests of the society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet it has been said by Mr. Ricardo that, “the interest of the landlord is always\n",
      "opposed to that of the consumer and the manufacturer,”† that is, to all the other orders\n",
      "in the state. To this opinion he has been led, very consistently, by the peculiar view he\n",
      "has taken of rent, which makes him state, that it is for the interest of the landlord that\n",
      "the cost attending the production of corn should be increased,‡ and that improvements\n",
      "in agriculture tend rather to lower than to raise rents.\n",
      "\n",
      "If this view of the theory of rent were just, and it were really true, that the income of\n",
      "the landlord is increased by increasing the difficulty, and diminished by increasing the\n",
      "facility of production, the opinion would unquestionably be well founded. But if, on\n",
      "the contrary, the landlord’s income is practically found to depend chiefly upon natural\n",
      "fertility of soil, improvements in agriculture, and inventions to save labour, we may\n",
      "still think, with Adam Smith, that the landlord’s interest is not opposed to that of the\n",
      "country.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is so obviously true, as to be hardly worth stating, that if the land of the greatest\n",
      "fertility were in such excessive plenty compared with the population, that every man\n",
      "might help himself to as much as he wanted, there would be no rents or landlords\n",
      "properly so called. It will also be readily allowed, that if in this or any other country\n",
      "you could suppose the soil suddenly to be made so fertile, that a tenth part of the\n",
      "surface, and a tenth part of the labour now employed upon it, could more than support\n",
      "the present population, you would for some time considerably lower rents.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it is of no sort of use to dwell upon, and draw general inferences from\n",
      "suppositions which never can take place.\n",
      "\n",
      "What we want to know is, whether, living as we do in a limited world, and in\n",
      "countries and districts still more limited, and under such physical laws relating to the\n",

      "incontrovertible principles confirmed by the most glaring facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever fanciful suppositions we may make about sudden improvements in fertility,\n",
      "nothing of this kind which we have ever seen or heard of in practice, approaches to\n",
      "what we know of the power of population to increase up to the additional means of\n",
      "subsistence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Improvements in agriculture, however considerable they may finally prove, are\n",
      "always found to be partial and gradual. And as, where they prevail to any extent, there\n",
      "is generally an effectual demand for labour, the increase of population occasioned by\n",
      "the increased facility of procuring food, soon overtakes the additional produce.\n",
      "Instead of land being thrown out of cultivation, more land is cultivated, owing to the\n",
      "cheapness of the instruments of cultivation, and under these circumstances rents rise\n",
      "instead of fall. These results appear to me to be so completely confirmed by\n",
      "experience, that I doubt, if a single instance in the history of Europe, or any other part\n",
      "of the world, can be produced, where improvements in agriculture have been\n",
      "practically found to lower rents.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should further say, that not only have improvements in agriculture never lowered\n",
      "rents, but that they have been hitherto, and may be expected to be in future, the main\n",
      "source of the increase of rents, in almost all the countries with which we are\n",
      "acquainted.*\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a fundamental part of the theory which has been explained in this chapter, that, as\n",
      "most countries consist of a gradation of soils, rents rise as cultivation is pushed on\n",
      "poorer lands; but still the connexion between rent and fertility subsists in\n",
      "undiminished force. The rich lands are those which yield the mass of rents, not the\n",
      "poor ones. The poor lands are cultivated, because the increasing capital and\n",
      "population are calling for more produce, and if there were no poor soils, there would\n",
      "still be rents; a limited territory, however fertile, would soon be peopled; and as the\n",
      "demand for corn increased compared with the supply, rents would rise.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is evident then, that difficulty of production has no connection with increase of rent,\n",
      "except as, in the actual state of most countries, it is the natural consequence of an\n",
      "increase of capital and population, and a fall of profits and corn wages; or, in other\n",
      "words, of an increase of wealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "But after all, the increase of rents which results from an increase of price occasioned\n",
      "solely by the greater quantity of labour and other conditions of supply, necessary to\n",
      "produce a given quantity of corn on fresh land, is very much more limited than has\n",
      "been supposed; and by a reference to most of the countries with which we are\n",
      "acquainted, it will be seen that, practically, improvements in agriculture and the\n",
      "saving of labour on the land, both have been, and may be expected in future to be, a\n",

      "would occasion an increasing demand for the products of agriculture, while the rates\n",

      "\n",
      "Similar observations may be made with regard to Poland, and indeed almost all the\n",

      "General Remarks On The Surplus Produce Of The Land.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems rather extraordinary that the very great benefit which society derives from\n",
      "that surplus produce of the land which, in the progress of society, falls mainly to the\n",
      "landlord in the shape of rent, should not yet be fully understood and acknowledged. I\n",
      "have called this surplus a bountiful gift of Providence, and am most decidedly of\n",
      "opinion, that it fully deserves the appellation. But Mr. Ricardo has the following\n",
      "passage:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing is more common than to hear of the advantages which the land possesses\n",
      "over every other source of useful produce, on account of the surplus which it yields in\n",
      "the form of rent. Yet when land is most abundant, when most productive and most\n",
      "fertile, it yields no rent; and it is only, when its powers decay, and less is yielded in\n",
      "return for labour, that a share of the original produce of the more fertile portions is set\n",
      "apart for rent. It is singular that this quality in the land, which should have been\n",
      "noticed as an imperfection, compared with the natural agents by which manufactures\n",
      "are assisted, should have been pointed out as constituting its peculiar pre-eminence. If\n",
      "air, water, the elasticity of steam, and the pressure of the atmosphere were of various\n",
      "qualities, if they could be appropriated, and each quality existed only in moderate\n",
      "abundance, they, as well as the land, would afford a rent, as the successive qualities\n",
      "were brought into use. With every worse quality employed, the value of the\n",
      "commodities in the manufacture of which they were used would rise, because equal\n",
      "quantities of labour would be less productive. Man would do more by the sweat of his\n",
      "brow, and nature perform less, and the land would be no longer pre-eminent for its\n",
      "limited powers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If the surplus produce which the land affords in the form of rent be an advantage, it\n",
      "is desirable that every year the machinery newly constructed should be less efficient\n",
      "than the old, as that would undoubtedly give a greater exchangeable value to the\n",
      "goods manufactured, not only by that machinery, but by all the other machinery in the\n",
      "kingdom; and a rent would be paid to all those who possessed the most productive\n",
      "machinery.”*\n",
      "\n",
      "What has been stated in the last section, distinctly shows how very erroneous this\n",
      "view of the subject is; but additional considerations press upon us here. In referring to\n",
      "a gift of Providence, we should surely speak of its value in relation to the laws and\n",
      "constitution of our nature, and of the world in which we live. But, if any person will\n",
      "take the trouble to make the calculation, he will see that if the necessaries of life could\n",
      "be obtained and distributed without limit, and the number of people could be doubled\n",
      "every twenty-five years, the population which might have been produced from a\n",
      "single pair since the Christian æra, would have been sufficient, not only to fill the\n",
      "earth quite full of people, so that four should stand in every square yard, but to fill all\n",

      "Without a total change in the constitution of human nature, and the situation of man\n",

      "A benevolent Creator then, knowing the wants and necessities of his creatures, under\n",
      "the laws to which he had subjected them, could not, in mercy, have furnished the\n",
      "whole of the necessaries of life in the same plenty as air and water. This shows at\n",
      "once the reason why the former are limited in quantity, and the latter poured out in\n",
      "profusion. But if it be granted, as it must be, that a limitation in the power of\n",
      "producing food is obviously necessary to man confined to a limited space, then the\n",
      "value of the actual quantity of land which he has received, depends upon the small\n",
      "quantity of labour necessary to work it, compared with the number of persons which it\n",
      "will support; or, in other words, upon that specific surplus so much under-rated by\n",

      "\n",
      "If manufactured commodities, by the gradations of machinery supposed by Mr.\n",
      "Ricardo, were to yield a rent, man, as he observes, would do more by the sweat of his\n",
      "brow;* and supposing him still to obtain the same quantity of commodities, (which,\n",
      "however, he would not,) the increase of his labour would be in proportion to the\n",
      "greatness of the rent so created. But the surplus, which a given quantity of land yields\n",
      "in the shape of rent, is totally different. Instead of being a measure of the increase of\n",
      "labour, which is necessary altogether to produce the quantity of corn which the land\n",
      "can yield, it is finally an exact measure of the relief from labour in the production of\n",
      "food granted to him by a kind Providence. If this final surplus be small, the labour of\n",
      "a large portion of the society must be constantly employed in procuring, by the sweat\n",
      "of their brows, the mere necessaries of life, and society must be most scantily\n",
      "provided with conveniences, luxuries, and leisure; while, if this surplus be large,\n",
      "manufactures, foreign luxuries, arts, letters, and leisure may abound.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a little singular, that Mr. Ricardo, who has, in general, kept his attention so\n",
      "steadily fixed on permanent and final results, as even to define the natural price of\n",
      "labour to be that price which would maintain a stationary population, although such a\n",
      "price cannot generally occur under moderately good governments, and in an ordinary\n",
      "state of things, for hundreds of years, has always, in treating of rent, adopted an\n",
      "opposite course, and referred almost entirely to temporary effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is obviously with this sort of reference, that he has objected to Adam Smith for\n",
      "saying that, in rice countries a greater share of the produce would belong to the\n",
      "landlord than in corn countries, and that rents in this country would rise, if potatoes\n",
      "were to become the favourite vegetable food of the common people, instead of corn.*\n",

      "Even on this supposition however, all the lands which had been thrown up, would be\n",
      "cultivated again in a very much less time, than it would take to reduce the price of\n",
      "labour, in a natural state of things, to the maintenance only of a stationary population.\n",

      "Mr. Ricardo has principally considered throughout his work, he ought to have allowed\n",
      "the truth of Adam Smith’s statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, in point of fact, there is every probability that not even a temporary fall of rent\n",
      "would take place. No nation ever has changed or ever will change the nature of its\n",
      "food all at once. The process, both in reference to the new system of cultivation to be\n",
      "adopted, and the new tastes to be generated, must necessarily be very slow. In the\n",
      "greater portion of Europe, it is probable, that a change from corn to rice could never\n",
      "take place; and where it could, it would require such great preparations for irrigation,\n",
      "as to give ample time for an increase of population fully equal to the increased\n",
      "quantity of food produced. In those countries where rice is actually grown, the rents\n",
      "are known to be very high. Dr. Buchanan, in his valuable travels through the Mysore,\n",
      "says, that in the watered lands below the Ghâts, the government was in the habit of\n",
      "taking two-thirds of the crop.* This is an amount of rent which probably no lands\n",
      "cultivated in corn can ever yield; and in those parts of India and other countries,\n",
      "where an actual change has taken place from the cultivation of corn to the cultivation\n",
      "of rice, I have little doubt that rents have not only finally risen very considerably, but\n",
      "have risen even during the progress of the change.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to potatoes, we have very near to us on opportunity of studying the\n",
      "effects of their becoming the vegetable food of the great mass of a people. The\n",
      "population of Ireland has increased faster during the last hundred years, than that of\n",
      "any other country in Europe; and under its actual government, this fact cannot be\n",
      "rationally accounted for, but from the introduction and gradual extension of the use of\n",
      "the potatoe. I am persuaded, that had it not been for the potatoe, the population of\n",
      "Ireland would not have much more than doubled, instead of much more than\n",
      "quadrupled, during the last century. This increase of population has prevented lands\n",
      "from being thrown out of cultivation, or given greater value to natural pasture, at the\n",
      "same time that it has occasioned a great fall in the comparative money wages of\n",
      "labour. This fall, experience tells us, has not been accompanied by a proportionate rise\n",
      "of profits, and the consequence is a considerable rise of rents. The wheat, oats, and\n",
      "cattle of Ireland are sold to England, and bear English money prices, while they are\n",
      "cultivated and tended by labour paid at half the money price; a state of things which\n",
      "must greatly increase either the revenue derived from profits, or the revenue derived\n",
      "from rents; and practical information assures us, that it is the latter which has derived\n",

      "in modern Europe, the general abundance of capital, the easy intercourse between\n",
      "different nations, and the laws of domestic and foreign competition prevent the\n",
      "possibility of large permanent returns being received for any other capitals than those\n",
      "employed on the land. No great commercial and manufacturing state in modern times,\n",
      "whatever may have been its skill, has yet been known permanently to make much\n",

      "The wages of labour are the remuneration to the labourer for his exertions.\n",
      "\n",
      "They may be divided into nominal and real.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nominal wages of labour consist of money; for it is in money that the labourer is\n",
      "generally paid in civilized countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The real wages of labour consist of the necessaries, conveniences, and luxuries of life,\n",
      "which the money wages of the labourer enable him to purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been shown in the fifth section of the second chapter of this work, that the\n",
      "average wages of a given number of common agricultural labourers, or what has been\n",
      "called standard wages, are always of the same value, that is, they are always obtained\n",
      "in each country, and at all times, at the same elementary cost. But it is well known\n",
      "that the quantity of money, of corn, or of the necessaries and conveniences of life,\n",
      "which is awarded to the labourer, is subject to great variations, all dependant upon the\n",
      "demand and supply of these objects compared with the demand and supply of labour.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the society can purchase a given quantity of money by commodities which require a\n",
      "smaller sacrifice of labour, profits, &c. to obtain them than is necessary to purchase or\n",
      "obtain the labour for which that money has before been usually exchanged, the money\n",
      "price of labour will rise. If either from the scarcity of money, or the plenty of labour,*\n",
      "a greater sacrifice must be made to obtain the given quantity of money, the money\n",
      "price of labour will fall. And whatever may be the state of the effectual demand for\n",
      "labour, it is obvious that the money price of labour must, on an average, be so\n",
      "proportioned to the price of the funds for its maintenance, as to effectuate the desired\n",
      "supply. It is as the condition of the supply, that the prices of the necessaries of life\n",
      "have so important an influence on the price of labour. A certain portion of these\n",
      "necessaries is required to enable the labourer to maintain a stationary population, a\n",
      "greater portion to maintain an increasing one; and consequently, whatever may be the\n",
      "prices of the necessaries of life, the money wages of the labourer must be such as to\n",
      "enable him to purchase these portions, or the supply cannot take place in the quantity\n",

      "The corn wages of labour are still more strikingly determined by the state of the\n",
      "demand and supply than money wages, on account of the variations in the quantity of\n",
      "corn being much greater in short periods than in the quantity of money. The great\n",
      "variations in the prices of corn in different seasons, while the money price of labour\n",
      "remains the same, are universally observed and acknowledged; but the variations of a\n",
      "more permanent kind in corn wages are sometimes not much less considerable. When\n",
      "the last land taken into cultivation in any country is fertile, and yet worked with some\n",
      "skill, there will be a large produce to divide between profits and wages, and it will\n",
      "depend upon the abundance of this produce and the manner in which it is divided, but\n",
      "chiefly on the former, whether the average corn wages are high or low. In the United\n",
      "States of America, for instance, the plenty and fertility of the land are such as to\n",
      "enable the farmers to pay to their labourers as much as 18 or 20 quarters of wheat in\n",
      "the year, above double the quantity usually paid in the greatest part of Europe, and yet\n",
      "to retain good profits. But it is known that the labouring classes of a country can more\n",
      "than keep up their numbers when paid only 8 or 9 quarters in the year. The question\n",
      "therefore whether the labourer shall be paid, on an average, 8 or 18 quarters, or any\n",
      "intermediate quantity, must depend upon the demand and supply of corn compared\n",
      "with the demand and supply of labour; and it is obvious that the labourer could not,\n",
      "for many years together, receive the larger quantity in any country where corn was not\n",
      "essentially of low value, that is obtained with a small quantity of labour.\n",
      "\n",
      "If instead of corn wages, or wages estimated in the prime necessary of life, we\n",
      "consider wages as consisting of the general necessaries and conveniences in which the\n",
      "money earnings of the labouring classes are usually spent, then if we suppose the\n",
      "agricultural labourer to be paid in the first instance in corn, his wages in necessaries\n",
      "and conveniences will depend partly upon the quantity of corn which he earns, and\n",
      "partly upon the value of that corn in exchange for the other necessaries of which he\n",
      "stands in need, such as clothing, housing, firing, soap, candles, leather, &c.; the one\n",
      "depending on the varying supply of corn to labour, and the other on the varying\n",
      "supply of corn to the other commodities wanted. Usually wages estimated in general\n",
      "necessaries and conveniences are more steady than corn wages; because most of the\n",
      "articles besides corn, of which they are composed, are less affected by the seasons,\n",
      "and consequently more regular in their supply than corn; but if these articles are\n",
      "compared directly with labour instead of corn, the quantity of them which shall be\n",
      "given to the labourer will still depend not only upon the varying powers of labour in\n",

      "determines the proportion of such necessaries which is awarded to the labourer.\n",

      "Adam Smith is practically quite correct, when he says, that, “the money price of\n",
      "labour is necessarily regulated by two circumstances; the demand for labour; and the\n",
      "price of the necessaries and conveniences of life.”* But it is of great importance to a\n",

      "In all those cases which Adam Smith has so happily explained and illustrated, where\n",
      "an apparent irregularity takes place in the wages of different kinds of labour, it will be\n",
      "found, universally, that the causes to which he justly attributes them, are causes of a\n",
      "nature to influence the supply of labour in the particular departments in question, and\n",
      "to determine such wages by the demand compared with the supply of the kind of\n",
      "labour required. The five principal circumstances, which, according to him, make up\n",
      "for a small pecuniary gain in some employments, and counterbalance a great one in\n",
      "others, namely; 1. The agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments\n",
      "themselves. 2. The easiness and cheapness, or the difficulty and expense of learning\n",
      "them. 3. The constancy or inconstancy of employment in them. 4. The small or great\n",
      "trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them; and 5. The probability or\n",
      "improbability of success in them,* are all obviously of this description; and in many\n",
      "of the cases stated, it would not be easy to account for their effects on the price of the\n",
      "different kinds of labour, upon any other principle. One hardly sees, for instance, why\n",
      "the cost of producing a poacher should be less than that of a common labourer, or the\n",
      "cost of producing a coal-heaver much greater; yet they are paid very differently. It is\n",
      "not easier to resolve the effects on wages of the small or great trust which must be\n",
      "reposed in a workman, or, the probability or improbability of success in his trade, into\n",
      "the quantity of labour, profits, &c. which has been employed to bring him into the\n",
      "market. Adam Smith satisfactorily shews, that the whole body of lawyers is not\n",
      "remunerated sufficiently to pay the expenses which the education of the whole body\n",
      "has cost;† and it is obvious that particular skill, both in trades and professions, is paid\n",
      "high, with but little reference to the labour employed in acquiring it, which, owing to\n",
      "superior talent, is often less than that which is frequently applied to the acquisition of\n",
      "inferior proficiency. But all these cases are accounted for in the easiest and most\n",
      "natural manner, upon the principle of supply and demand. Superior artists are paid\n",
      "high on account of the scanty supply of such skill, whether occasioned by unusual\n",
      "labour or uncommon genius, or both. Lawyers, as a body, are not well remunerated,\n",
      "because the prevalence of other motives, besides mere gain, crowds the profession\n",
      "with candidates, and the supply is not regulated by the cost of the education; and in all\n",
      "those instances, where disadvantages or difficulties of any kind accompany particular\n",
      "employments, it is obvious that they must be paid comparatively high, because if the\n",
      "additional remuneration were not sufficient to balance such disadvantages, the supply\n",
      "of labour in these departments would be deficient, as, cæteris paribus, every person\n",
      "would choose to engage in the most agreeable, the least difficult, and the least\n",
      "uncertain occupations. The deficiency so occasioned, whenever it occurs, will\n",
      "naturally raise the price of labour; and the advance of price, after some little\n",
      "oscillation, will rest at the point where it is just sufficient to occasion a supply suited\n",
      "to the effectual demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adam Smith has in general referred to the principle of supply and demand in cases of\n",
      "this kind, but he has occasionally forgotten it:—“If one species of labour,” he says,\n",
      "“requires an uncommon degree of dexterity and ingenuity, the esteem which men\n",
      "have for such talents will give a value to their produce, superior to what would be due\n",
      "to the time employed about it.”* And in another place, speaking of China, he remarks,\n",

      "should define to be, the actual price in the market, which from temporary causes is\n",
      "sometimes above, and sometimes below, what is necessary to supply this demand.\n",

      "\n",
      "There is another cause, besides a change in the habits of the people, which prevents\n",
      "the population of a country from keeping pace with the apparent command of the\n",
      "labourer over the means of subsistence. It sometimes happens that corn wages are\n",
      "comparatively high without a proportionate demand for labour. This is the most likely\n",
      "to take place when the price of raw produce has fallen without a fall in the price of\n",
      "labour, so as to disable the cultivators from employing the same quantity of labour as\n",
      "before. If the fall be considerable, and not made up in value by increase of quantity,\n",
      "so many labourers will be thrown out of work that wages, after a period of great\n",
      "distress, will generally be lowered in proportion. But if the fall be gradual, and partly\n",
      "made up in exchangeable value by increase of quantity, the money wages of labour\n",
      "will not necessarily sink; and the result will be merely a slack demand for labour, not\n",
      "sufficient perhaps to throw the actual labourers out of work, but such as to prevent or\n",
      "diminish task-work, to check the employment of women and children, and to give but\n",
      "little encouragement to the rising generation of labourers. In this case the quantity of\n",
      "the necessaries of life actually earned by the labourer and his family, may be really\n",
      "less than when, owing to a rise of prices, the daily pay of the labourer will command a\n",
      "smaller quantity of corn. The command of the labouring classes over the necessaries\n",
      "of life, though apparently greater, is really less in the former than in the latter case,\n",
      "and, upon all general principles, ought to produce less effect on the increase of\n",
      "population.\n",
      "\n",
      "This disagreement between apparent wages and the progress of population will be\n",
      "further aggravated in those countries where poor laws are established, and it has\n",
      "become customary to pay a portion of the labourers’ wages out of the parish rates. If,\n",
      "when corn rises, the farmers and landholders of a parish keep the wages of labour\n",
      "down, and make a regular allowance for children, it is obvious that there is no longer\n",
      "any necessary connexion between the apparent corn wages of day labour and the real\n",
      "means which the labouring classes possess of maintaining a family. When once the\n",
      "people are reconciled to such a system, the progress of population might be rapid, at a\n",
      "time when the real wages of labour, independently of parish assistance, were only\n",
      "sufficient to support a wife and one child, or even a single man without either wife or\n",

      "Some writers of great ability have been of opinion that rising prices, occasioned by an\n",
      "influx of bullion, are very unfavourable to the labouring classes of society; and\n",
      "certainly there are some periods of our history which seem strongly to countenance\n",

      "will be found that, in the instances in question, other causes were in operation to\n",
      "which the effect referred to might more justly be attributed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The period of our history more particularly noticed is the 16th century, from the end\n",

      "an unquestionable fact that the corn wages of labour fell in an extraordinary degree,\n",
      "and towards the latter end of the century they would not command much above one-\n",
      "third of the quantity of wheat which they did at the beginning of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir F. M. Eden has noticed the price of wheat in nineteen out of the twenty-four years\n",
      "of Henry VII.’s reign, and in some of the years two or three times.* Reducing the\n",
      "several notices in the same year first to an average, and then taking the average of the\n",
      "nineteen prices, it comes to 6s. 3¼d. the quarter, rather less than 9½d. the bushel, and\n",
      "2⅜d. the peck.\n",
      "\n",
      "By a statute passed in 1495 to regulate wages, the price of common day labour seems\n",
      "to have been 4d. or 4½d. without diet. All labourers and artificers, not specifically\n",
      "mentioned, are put down at 4d.; but in another part of the statute, even a woman\n",
      "labourer (I suppose in hay time) is set down at 4½d. and a carter at 5d.*\n",
      "\n",
      "At the price of wheat just stated, if the wages of the labourer were 4d. he would be\n",

      "Review Of The Prices Of Corn And Labour During The Five\n",
      "Last Centuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "From this review of the prices of corn and labour, during nearly the five last centuries,\n",
      "we may draw some important inferences.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place, I think it appears that the great fall in the corn wages of labour\n",
      "which took place in the 16th century, must have been occasioned mainly by the great\n",
      "and unusual elevation which they had previously attained, and not by the discovery of\n",
      "the American mines and the consequent fall in the value of money. When we compare\n",
      "the corn wages of labour during the last half of the 15th century, with what they were\n",
      "both before and subsequently, it appears that whatever may have been the cause of\n",
      "these high wages, they were evidently peculiar, and could not therefore be permanent.\n",
      "This indeed is evident, not only by comparing them with previous and subsequent\n",
      "periods, but by considering their positive amount. Earnings of the value of nearly two\n",
      "pecks or half a bushel of wheat a day would allow of the earliest marriages, and the\n",
      "maintenance of the largest families. They are nearly the same as the earnings of the\n",
      "labourer in the United States. In such a country as England was, even at that time,\n",
      "such wages could only be occasioned by temporary causes. Among these we must\n",
      "reckon, a general improvement in the system of cultivation after the abolition of\n",
      "villanage, which increased the plenty of corn; and the comparatively rapid progress of\n",
      "commerce and manufactures, which occasioned a great demand for labour; while,\n",
      "owing to the wars in France, the civil wars between the Houses of York and\n",
      "Lancaster, and above all perhaps the slow change of habits among a people lately\n",
      "emancipated, this increase of produce and demand had not yet been followed by a\n",
      "proportionate effect on the population.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certain it is that corn was very cheap both in France* and England; and labour in this\n",
      "country could not possibly have risen and kept high for so long a period as between\n",
      "sixty and seventy years, unless some peculiar cause or causes had restrained the\n",
      "supply of population, compared with the supply of corn and the demand for labour.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is with the fact however of the very high wages of labour in the 15th century rather\n",
      "than with the causes of it, that we are chiefly concerned at present, and of the fact\n",
      "there can be no doubt; but if the fact be allowed, it follows, that such wages must have\n",
      "very greatly fallen during the course of the following century, if the mines of America\n",
      "had not been discovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "What effect the depreciation of money might have had in aggravating that increasing\n",
      "poverty of the labouring classes of society, which, with or without such a\n",
      "depreciation, would inevitably have fallen upon them, it is not easy to say. But from\n",

      "ceased, and from what has happened of late years (which shall be more fully noticed\n",
      "presently) I should not be disposed to consider a general rise in the price of corn,\n",
      "occasioned by an alteration in the value of money, and not by bad seasons, as likely to\n",
      "affect the labouring classes prejudicially for more than a few years. Still, however, it\n",
      "is quite certain that the condition of the labouring classes was growing much worse\n",
      "during the time that the depreciation of money from the discovery of the American\n",
      "mines was taking place; and whatever may have been the cause, as the people would\n",
      "always be comparing their situation with what it had been, in their own recollection\n",
      "and that of their fathers, it would inevitably excite great complaints; and, after it had\n",
      "grown comparatively very bad, as in the latter end of the reign of Elizabeth, it was\n",
      "likely to lead to those measures relating to the poor, which marked that period of our\n",
      "history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another inference which we may draw from the review is, that during the course of\n",
      "nearly 500 years, the earnings of a day’s labour in this country have probably been\n",
      "more frequently below than above a peck of wheat; that a peck of wheat may be\n",
      "considered as something like a middle point, or a point rather above the middle, about\n",
      "which the corn wages of labour, varying according to the demand and supply, have\n",
      "oscillated; and that the population of a country may increase with some rapidity, while\n",
      "the wages of labour are even under this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wages of day labour in France during the two last centuries, are said to have been\n",
      "pretty uniformly about the 20th part of a septier of wheat,* which would be a little\n",
      "above ? of a peck; but just before the revolution, at the time of Arthur Young’s tour in\n",
      "France, they were only about ¾ of a peck. For some time subsequently to the\n",
      "revolution, they appear to have risen so as to command more than a peck.\n",
      "\n",
      "A third inference which we may draw from this review is, that the seasons have a very\n",
      "considerable influence on the price of corn, not only for two or three years\n",
      "occasionally, but for fifteen or twenty years together, and sometimes much longer.\n",
      "These periods of unfavourable seasons seem to supersede all the other causes which\n",
      "may be supposed to have the greatest influence upon prices. An instance of this\n",
      "occurs after the great pestilence in the time of Edward III. One should naturally have\n",
      "thought that the quantity of good land being abundant, compared with the population,\n",
      "corn would have been very cheap. It was, however, on the contrary, dear during the\n",
      "twenty-five subsequent years,—a fact which cannot be accounted for but from\n",
      "unfavourable seasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another instance of the same kind had occurred in the reign of Edward II., during the\n",
      "whole of which, the average price of wheat was more than double what it had been\n",
      "during the greatest part of the reign of Edward I., and the first half of the reign of\n",
      "Edward III.—evidently owing to unfavourable seasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "A third instance occurs during the civil wars of the 17th century. So far from thinking\n",
      "that civil wars have a necessary tendency to make corn dear, I am disposed to agree\n",
      "with Sir F. Eden, in attributing a part of the high price of labour and the cheapness of\n",
      "corn in the 15th century, to the circumstance of a greater destruction of men than of\n",

      "Lancaster. But in the civil wars of the 17th century, no such cheapness of corn took\n",
      "place. On the contrary, in the period from 1646 to 1665 the price of corn was higher\n",
      "both in France and England than it had ever been known for twenty years together,\n",
      "either before or since, exclusive of the prices in this country during the war of the\n",
      "French Revolution. For shorter periods, these unfavourable seasons are of frequent\n",
      "recurrence, and must essentially affect the condition of the labourer during ten or five\n",
      "years. It depends upon their continuance and other concomitant circumstances,\n",
      "whether they raise money wages, or leave them as they were.\n",
      "\n",
      "The periods of the lowest corn wages have been, when a considerable rise in the price\n",
      "of corn has taken place under circumstances not favourable to a proportionate rise in\n",
      "the price of labour. This is the most likely to happen in unfavourable seasons, when it\n",
      "would be impossible for the price of labour to rise in proportion to the price of corn. It\n",
      "may also happen when a fall is taking place in the value of money, if any previous\n",
      "causes have given an extraordinary stimulus to the progress of population. In this\n",
      "case, though the funds for the maintenance of labour may be increasing fast, the\n",
      "population may be increasing faster, and the money wages of labour will not rise in\n",
      "proportion to the price of corn. To this cause I am strongly disposed to attribute the\n",
      "inadequate rise of the money wages of labour during the reigns of Henry VIII., Mary,\n",
      "Edward VI., and Elizabeth. The state of things in the early part of the 16th century\n",
      "must have given a powerful stimulus to population; and considering the extraordinary\n",
      "high corn wages at this period, and that they could only fall very gradually, the\n",
      "stimulus must have continued to operate with considerable force during the greatest\n",
      "part of the century. In fact, depopulation was loudly complained of at the end of the\n",
      "15th and beginning of the 16th centuries, and a redundancy of population was\n",
      "acknowledged at the end of the 16th. And it was this change in the state of the\n",
      "population, and not the discovery of the American mines, which occasioned so\n",
      "marked a fall in the corn wages of labour.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the discovery of the American mines had found the labouring classes of the people\n",
      "earning only the same wages which they appear to have earned in the latter half of the\n",
      "reign of Edward III., and if the same increase of capital and produce had taken place\n",
      "during the 16th century, as really did take place, there is every probability that the\n",
      "money wages of labour would have increased as much as the money price of corn.\n",
      "Indeed when an increase of currency is accompanied, as it frequently is, by a rapid\n",
      "increase of capital, there is one reason, why, in the natural state of things, the price of\n",
      "labour should feel it more than other commodities. The encouragement given to\n",
      "population by such increase of resources, could not appear with any considerable\n",
      "effect in the market under sixteen or eighteen years;* and before that time the demand\n",
      "compared with the supply of labour might be greater than the demand compared with\n",
      "the supply of most other commodities.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is on this account, that in the fall in the value of money which took place from 1793\n",
      "to 1814, and which was unquestionably accompanied by a great increase of capital,\n",
      "and a great demand for labour, there is strong reason to believe, that if the price of\n",

      "compared with the wages of 1767, 1768 and 1770,† is equal to the rise in the price of\n",
      "wheat during the same period. Now it is known that in many counties and districts in\n",

      "\n",
      "The profits of capital consist of the difference between the value of a commodity\n",

      "consequently, leaves the capitalist in a short time with the same or nearly the same\n",
      "rate of profits. The workman receives a larger quantity of what he produces, but the\n",

      "varying value of the produce of the same quantity of labour occasioned by the\n",
      "accidental or ordinary state of the demand and supply, by which a greater or smaller\n",
      "proportion of that produce falls to the share of the labourers employed. This may be\n",
      "called the regulating principle of profits, this second cause is constantly modifying\n",
      "the first, but it will be desirable to consider them separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "If then we suppose the first cause to operate singly, and the corn wages of the\n",
      "individual labourer to be always the same, the whole skill in agriculture remained\n",
      "unchanged, and there were no taxes nor any means of obtaining corn from foreign\n",
      "countries, the rate of profits must regularly fall, as the society advanced, and as it\n",
      "became necessary to resort to inferior machines which required more labour to put in\n",
      "action.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would signify little, in this case, whether the last land taken into cultivation for food\n",

      "allow it to be cultivated, unless he could, at the least, obtain the same rent for it as\n",

      "\n",
      "In order to see more clearly the powerful effects of the second cause on profits, let us\n",
      "consider it for a moment as operating alone; and suppose, that while the capital and\n",
      "produce of a country continued increasing, its population were checked and kept short\n",
      "of the demand for it, by some miraculous influence. Under these circumstances, a\n",
      "gradation would take place in the proportion which capital and produce would bear to\n",

      "in the actual state of things, particularly in this country. And here it is evident that we\n",
      "shall have in operation both the causes already stated, with others which disturb and\n",
      "modify them.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the progressive cultivation of poor land, occasioned by the increase of capital and\n",
      "population, profits as far as they depend upon natural fertility, will regularly fall; but\n",
      "if at the same time improvements in agriculture are taking place, they may certainly\n",
      "be such as, for a considerable period, not only to prevent profits from falling, but to\n",
      "allow of a rise. To what extent, and for what length of time, this circumstance might\n",
      "interrupt the progressive fall of profits occasioned by the necessity of taking poorer\n",
      "land into cultivation, without such improvements, it is not easy to say; but, as it is\n",
      "certain that in an extensive territory, consisting of soils not very different in their\n",
      "natural powers of production, the fall of profits arising from this cause would be slow,\n",
      "it is probable that for a considerable extent of time agricultural improvements,\n",
      "including of course the improved implements and machinery used in cultivation, as\n",
      "well as an improved system of cropping and managing the land, might more than\n",
      "balance it.\n",
      "\n",
      "A second circumstance which would contribute to the same effect is, an increase of\n",
      "personal exertion among the labouring classes. This exertion is extremely different in\n",
      "different countries, and at different times in the same country. A day’s labour of a\n",
      "Hindoo, or a South-American Indian, will not admit of a comparison with that of an\n",
      "Englishman; and it has even been said, that though the money price of day-labour in\n",
      "Ireland is little more than the half of what it is in England, yet that Irish labour is not\n",
      "really cheaper than English, although it is well known that Irish labourers when in this\n",
      "country, with good examples and adequate wages to stimulate them, will work as hard\n",
      "as their English companions.\n",

      "This latter circumstance alone clearly shows how different may be the personal\n",
      "exertions of the labouring classes in the same country at different times; and how\n",
      "different therefore may be the products of a given number of days labour, as the\n",
      "society proceeds from the indolence of the savage to the activity of the civilized state.\n",
      "This activity indeed, within certain limits, appears almost always to come forward\n",
      "when it is most called for, that is, when there is much work to be done without a full\n",
      "supply of persons to do it. The personal exertions of the South American Indian, the\n",

      "A third circumstance which has a considerable effect on profits, and not unfrequently\n",
      "occurs, is, the unequal rise of some parts of the farmer’s capital, when the price of\n",
      "corn is raised by an increased demand. Under such a rise, (which if it continues is\n",
      "generally accompanied by an advanced price of standard labour, or a fall in the value\n",
      "of money,) the prices of many home commodities will be considerably modified for\n",
      "some time, by the unequal pressure of taxation, and the unequal rise in the prices of\n",
      "foreign commodities, and of the commodities worked up at home from foreign\n",
      "materials. The rise of corn and labour at home will not proportionally raise the price\n",
      "of such products; and as far as these products together with taxes, form a part of the\n",
      "farmer’s capital, a smaller proportion of the produce, owing to its increased value,\n",
      "will replace it. This remark is applicable to leather, timber, soap, candles, cottons,\n",
      "woollens, &c. &c., all of which enter more or less into the capitals of the farmer, or\n",
      "the wages of the labourer, and are all influenced in their prices more or less by\n",
      "importation.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fourth circumstance, which favours a rise of profits is a fall in the prices of some\n",
      "important manufactures, as compared with corn, owing to improvements in\n",
      "machinery. This state of things always allows of some diminution in the corn wages\n",
      "of labour without a proportionate diminution of the comforts of the labourer: and if\n",
      "the money price of the farmer’s produce increases without a proportionate increase in\n",
      "the price of labour, and in the materials of which his advances consist, his profits must\n",
      "necessarily rise.\n",
      "\n",
      "It appears then, that practically, and in the actual state of things, the physical necessity\n",
      "of a fall of profits in agriculture arising from the increasing quantity of labour\n",
      "required to produce the same quantity of food, may be so counteracted and overcome,\n",
      "for a considerable time by other causes, as to leave very great play to the influence of\n",
      "the competitions of capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "The facts which support this conclusion are numerous and incontrovertible. It may be\n",
      "said, indeed, with truth that the different rates of profits during periods of peace and\n",
      "war, which are observed to take place in all countries, are chiefly attributable to the\n",
      "abundance or scarcity of capital and produce compared with the demand, and not to\n",
      "the varying productiveness of labour on the land. To the instances of this kind which\n",

      "strong as to be alone almost decisive of the question, and having happened in our own\n",

      "\n",
      "From the accession of George II. in 1727 to the commencement of the war in 1793,\n",
      "the interest of money was little more than 3 per cent. The public securities which had\n",
      "been reduced to 4 per cent. rose considerably after the reduction. According to\n",
      "Chalmers, the natural rate of interest ran steadily at 3 per cent.;* and it appears by a\n",

      "The temporary variations in the value of government securities will not certainly at all\n",

      "when they remain nearly steady for some time together, they must be considered as a\n",

      "After an interval of nearly seventy years from the commencement of the period here\n",

      "of interest was rather above than below 5 per cent.; and we have certainly every\n",
      "reason to think, from the extraordinary rapidity with which capital was recovered,\n",
      "after it had been destroyed, that the rate of profits in general was quite in proportion to\n",
      "this high rate of interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The difficulty of borrowing on mortgage during a considerable part of the time is\n",

      "before, 32 or 32½,* —the most decisive proof that can well be imagined of an\n",

      "The nature of these facts, and the state of things under which they took place, (in the\n",
      "one case, in a state of peace with a slack demand for capital and produce, and in the\n",
      "other, a state of war with an unusual demand for both,) obviously and clearly point to\n",
      "the relative redundancy or deficiency of capital and produce as their cause. And the\n",
      "question which now remains to be considered, is, whether the circumstances which\n",
      "have been stated in this section are sufficient to account theoretically for such a free\n",
      "operation of this principle, notwithstanding the progressive accumulation of capital,\n",
      "and the progressive cultivation of fresh land, as to allow of low profits at an earlier\n",

      "Remarks On Mr. Ricardo’S Theory Of Profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Mr. Ricardo profits are regulated by wages, and are high or low in\n",
      "proportion as wages are low or high;† or as he has expressed himself more fully in\n",
      "another part of his chapter on profits,\n",
      "\n",
      "“In all countries, and at all times, profits depend upon the quantity of labour requisite\n",
      "to provide necessaries for the labourers on that land, or with that capital which yields\n",
      "no rent.”‡\n",
      "\n",
      "It is here understood, that there are no other advances except those of wages; and,\n",
      "under these circumstances, the necessaries required to pay ten labourers must have\n",
      "required fewer than ten labourers to produce them, or there would have been no\n",
      "profits. It is further obvious that the profits upon the produce necessary to pay the\n",
      "wages of ten labourers must depend upon the difference between the whole produce,\n",
      "and that portion of it which is required to pay the number of labourers, whether nine,\n",
      "eight, seven, or any other proportion actually employed to produce the wages of the\n",
      "whole ten.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Ricardo’s proposition therefore will be found to be essentially the same as if he\n",
      "had said that profits are determined by the proportion of the produce which goes to\n",
      "pay the wages of the labour which obtained it. And so far this theory is quite correct.\n",
      "But in its application he combines with it two assumptions, which being unfounded\n",
      "renders it as a whole essentially erroneous. He assumes,*\n",
      "\n",
      "1st. That the commodities which have cost in their production the same quantity of\n",
      "labour will on an average always be of the same value. And\n",
      "\n",
      "2ndly. That the value of the same quantity of labour varies in proportion to the share\n",
      "of the produce which goes to pay the labourer; and the varying value of this labour\n",
      "being thus taken out of the supposed constant value of the produce obtained by them,\n",
      "the remainder determines the rate of profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "If these assumptions were well founded the theory would be correct. But it has been\n",
      "shewn, in the 4th section of the 2nd chapter, that commodities which have cost in\n",
      "their production the same quantity of labour, or the same value of capital, are subject\n",
      "to great variations of value, owing to the varying rate and varying quantity of profits\n",
      "which must be added to the quantity of accumulated and immediate labour employed\n",
      "upon them, in order to make up their value.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it has further been shewn in the 6th section of the same chapter that, however\n",
      "variable may be the quantity or proportion of produce awarded to each labourer, the\n",
      "value of that quantity or proportion will always be the same.\n",

      "\n",
      "It is clear then that profits must be regulated upon a principle essentially different\n",
      "from that stated by Mr. Ricardo, and that instead of being determined by the varying\n",
      "value of a certain quantity of labour employed, compared with the given value of the\n",
      "commodity produced, they will be determined by the varying value of the commodity\n",
      "produced compared with the given value of the certain quantity of labour employed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This conclusion will appear strikingly obvious, if we adopt that supposition respecting\n",
      "the mode of procuring the precious metals which would certainly maintain them most\n",
      "strictly of the same value, that is, if we suppose them to be procured by a uniform\n",
      "quantity of unassisted labour without any advances in the shape of capital beyond the\n",
      "necessaries of a single day. That the precious metals would in this case retain, more\n",
      "completely than in any other, the same value cannot be denied, as the quantity of\n",
      "labour actually employed in their production, and the quantity of labour they would\n",
      "command would be the same. But in this case, as was before stated, the money price\n",
      "of labour must remain permanently the same. We cannot however for a moment\n",
      "imagine that this impossibility of a rise or fall in the money price of labour could in\n",
      "any respect impede or interrupt the natural career of profits. The continued\n",
      "accumulation of capital and increasing difficulty of procuring subsistence would\n",
      "unquestionably lower profits. All commodities, in the production of which the same\n",
      "quantity of labour continued to be employed, but with the assistance of capitals of\n",
      "various kinds and amount, would fall in price, and just in proportion to the degree in\n",
      "which the price of the commodity had before been affected by profits; and with regard\n",
      "to corn, in the production of which more labour would be necessary, this article would\n",
      "rise in money price just to that point which would so reduce corn wages as to retard\n",
      "the progress of population in proportion to the diminution of effectual demand; and\n",
      "thus all the effects upon profits, attributed by Mr. Ricardo to a rise of money wages,\n",
      "would take place while money wages and the value of money remained precisely the\n",
      "same. It is obvious that, in this case, profits can only be regulated by the principle of\n",
      "competition, or of demand and supply, which would determine the degree in which\n",
      "the prices of commodities would fall; and their prices, compared with the uniform\n",
      "price of labour, would regulate the rate of profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "If however instead of supposing gold to be obtained by immediate labour alone in the\n",
      "way here stated, we suppose with Mr. Ricardo that it is obtained by fixed and\n",
      "circulating capitals in certain proportions, it will be found (as we have before\n",
      "intimated) that the state of prices and the rise of labour, contemplated by him in the\n",
      "progress of cultivation, are owing to a fall in the value of money, and not to a rise in\n",
      "the value of labour.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a further illustration of this point so essential to a just theory of profits, let us\n",
      "suppose a country supplied with gold by a mine of its own, from which the same\n",
      "quantity of metal could always be obtained by the same quantity of labour with the\n",
      "same value of other capital; and further let us suppose, that at a particular period the\n",
      "accumulation of capital was increasing faster than the effectual demand for the\n",
      "produce at its former price; under these circumstances, let us consider what would be\n",
      "the consequences on the prices of commodities and labour. It is obvious that all those\n",
      "commodities which continued to be obtained by the same quantity of labour with the\n",

      "gold among the rest becoming more abundant, a different division of the produce\n",
      "would take place between the labourers and the capitalists; a smaller proportion of it\n",
      "would go to pay profits, and a larger proportion to pay wages. Profits therefore would\n",
      "fall, and the money wages of labour would rise. And the question is whether the rise\n",
      "in the money wages of labour ought to be considered as a rise in the value of labour,\n",
      "or a fall in the value of money. Mr. Ricardo considers it a rise in the value of labour,\n",
      "and has founded all his calculations in his chapters on rent, wages, and profits, on this\n",
      "assumption. If indeed the value of the produce of the same quantity of labour, or of\n",
      "labour and capital,* were to remain the same, which is what he supposes, then it\n",
      "would be quite true that if a larger proportion of this produce went to pay the wages of\n",
      "labour, the value of labour would rise. But if the value of the produce falls, then the\n",
      "circumstance of a larger proportion of the produce going to pay the wages of labour\n",
      "by no means implies that the value of labour has risen. It only implies that the\n",
      "labourer receives a larger quantity of an article which has fallen in value. And that in\n",
      "the present case the article has fallen in value may with certainty be inferred both\n",
      "from the state of the supply compared with the demand, and the elementary costs of\n",
      "its production. It has been assumed that the supply is comparatively more abundant\n",
      "than before, on account of the increase of capital, although the productiveness of\n",
      "labour has remained the same. This must necessarily occasion a fall of profits, and\n",
      "this fall will be permanent if the same competition of capital continues. But if the rate\n",
      "of profits has fallen the elementary costs of production have fallen. In this case, the\n",
      "conditions of the supply of a certain quantity of gold are the advance of the same\n",
      "quantity of labour, with the same value of other capital, as before, and a less\n",
      "remuneration for profits. Consequently the elementary cost of gold to the purchaser is\n",
      "less than before.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it be said, as Mr. Ricardo says, that a greater quantity of labour is required to\n",
      "produce the corn which pays the wages of the labourer, this may be conceded; but as a\n",
      "proportionate fall of profits is found to have taken place, the diminution of the\n",
      "element of profits balances* the increase of the element of labour, leaving the value of\n",
      "labour the same as before, while its increased price is occasioned by the fall in the\n",
      "value of money. And that the value of money must have fallen is further evident from\n",
      "the conclusions of Mr. Ricardo himself, quite independently of the measure which I\n",
      "have applied to it. According to his theory the prices of manufactured commodities,\n",
      "which have not been produced by improved machinery, will, in the progress of\n",
      "cultivation, remain nearly the same, while labour and all raw products will rise. If\n",
      "therefore we measure the value of money by its general power of purchasing, its fall is\n",
      "decidedly established. Of a certain mass of objects it purchases the same quantity as\n",
      "before; of a much larger mass of objects it purchases a smaller quantity.\n",

      "demand and supply. The boundary to the further value of and effectual demand for\n",

      "It has been justly stated by Adam Smith that a man is rich or poor according to the\n",
      "degree in which he can afford to enjoy the necessaries, conveniences, and luxuries of\n",
      "human life. And it follows from this definition that, if the bounty of nature furnished\n",
      "all the necessaries, conveniences and luxuries of life to every inhabitant of a country\n",
      "in the fullest measure of proportion to his wishes, such a country would be in the\n",
      "highest degree wealthy, without possessing any thing which would have exchangeable\n",
      "value, or could command a single hour’s labour.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this state of things, undoubtedly, wealth has nothing to do with exchangeable value.\n",
      "But as this is not the actual state of things, nor likely to be so at any future time; as the\n",
      "bounty of nature furnishes but few of the necessaries, conveniences and luxuries of\n",
      "life to man without the aid of his own exertions; and as the great practical stimulus to\n",
      "exertion is the desire to possess what can only be possessed by means of some labour\n",
      "or sacrifice, it will be found that, in the real state in which man is placed on earth,\n",
      "wealth and exchangeable value, though still by no means the same, are in many points\n",
      "nearly connected.\n",
      "\n",
      "In considering the different quantities of the same commodity which, under different\n",
      "circumstances, have the same exchangeable value, the distinction is indeed perfectly\n",
      "obvious. Stockings do not lose half their power of contributing to the comfort and\n",
      "convenience of the wearer, because by improved machinery they can be made at half\n",
      "the price, or their exchangeable value be reduced one half. It will be readily allowed\n",
      "that the man who has two pairs of stockings of the same quality instead of one pair,\n",
      "possesses, as far as stockings are concerned, a double portion of the conveniences of\n",

      "Yet even in this case he is not in all respects doubly rich. If, indeed, he means to use\n",

      "some writers, but if he means to exchange them for other commodities, he certainly\n",
      "has not; as one pair of stockings, under certain circumstances, may command more\n",

      "eyes on any nation of the world without seeing a striking confirmation of what has\n",
      "been advanced. Almost universally, the actual wealth of all the states with which we\n",

      "the slowest progress in wealth is often made where the stimulus arising from\n",

      "against the actual limits of subsistence. It is quite evident that the only fair way,\n",
      "indeed the only way, by which we can judge of the practical effect of population alone\n",
      "as a stimulus to wealth, is to refer to those countries where, from the excess of\n",
      "population above the funds applied to the maintenance of labour, the stimulus of want\n",
      "is the greatest. And if in these countries, which still have great powers of production,\n",

      "To suppose a great and continued increase of population is to beg the question. We\n",

      "of wealth. The question really is, whether encouragements to population, or even the\n",
      "natural tendency of population to increase beyond the funds destined for its\n",
      "maintenance, will, or will not, alone furnish an adequate stimulus to the increase of\n",

      "Those who reject mere population as an adequate stimulus to the increase of wealth,\n",
      "are generally disposed to make every thing depend upon accumulation. It is certainly\n",
      "true that no permanent and continued increase of wealth can take place without a\n",
      "continued increase of capital; and I cannot agree with Lord Lauderdale in thinking\n",
      "that this increase can be effected in any other way than by saving from the stock\n",
      "which might have been destined for immediate consumption, and adding it to that\n",
      "which is to yield a profit; or in other words, by the conversion of revenue into\n",
      "capital.*\n",
      "\n",
      "But we have yet to inquire what is the state of things which generally disposes a\n",

      "accumulation the most effective, and lead to a further and continued increase of\n",
      "capital and wealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is undoubtedly possible by parsimony to devote at once a much larger share than\n",
      "usual of the produce of any country to the maintenance of productive labour; and\n",
      "suppose this to be done, it is quite true that the labourers so employed are consumers\n",
      "as well as those engaged in personal services, and that as far as the labourers are\n",
      "concerned, there would be no diminution of consumption or demand. But it has\n",
      "already been shewn that the consumption and demand occasioned by the workmen\n",
      "employed in productive labour can never alone furnish a motive to the accumulation\n",
      "and employment of capital; and with regard to the capitalists themselves, together\n",
      "with the landlords and other rich persons, they have, by the supposition, agreed to be\n",
      "parsimonious, and by depriving themselves of their usual conveniencies and luxuries\n",
      "to save from their revenue and add to their capital. Under these circumstances, it is\n",
      "impossible that the increased quantity of commodities, obtained by the increased\n",
      "number of productive labourers, should find purchasers, without such a fall of price as\n",
      "would probably sink their value below that of the outlay, or, at least, so reduce profits\n",
      "as very greatly to diminish both the power and the will to save.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been thought by some very able writers, that although there may easily be a glut\n",
      "of particular commodities, there cannot possibly be a glut of commodities in general;\n",
      "because, according to their view of the subject, commodities being always exchanged\n",
      "for commodities, one half will furnish a market for the other half, and production\n",
      "being thus the sole source of demand, an excess in the supply of one article merely\n",
      "proves a deficiency in the supply of some other, and a general excess is impossible.\n",
      "M. Say, in his distinguished work on political economy, has indeed gone so far as to\n",

      "we compare them, as we certainly ought to do, with the means of producing them, and\n",
      "with the numbers and wants of the consumers, then a great increase of produce with\n",
      "comparatively stationary numbers or with wants diminished by parsimony, must\n",
      "necessarily occasion a great fall of value estimated in labour, so that the same\n",
      "produce, though it might have cost the same quantity of labour as before, would no\n",
      "longer command the same quantity; and both the power of accumulation and the\n",
      "motive to accumulate would be strongly checked.\n",

      "It is asserted that effectual demand is nothing more than the offering of one\n",

      "this all that is necessary to effectual demand? Though each commodity may have cost\n",
      "the same quantity of labour in its production, and they may be exactly equivalent to\n",
      "each other in exchange, yet why may not both be so plentiful as not to command more\n",

      "It will be readily allowed that a new commodity thrown into the market, which, in\n",
      "proportion to the labour employed upon it, is of higher exchangeable value than usual,\n",
      "is precisely calculated to increase demand; because it implies, not a mere increase of\n",
      "quantity, but an increase of value owing to a better adaptation of the produce to the\n",
      "tastes, wants and consumption of the society. But to fabricate or procure commodities\n",
      "of this kind is the grand difficulty; and they certainly do not naturally and necessarily\n",

      "redundant, is obliged to make the following concession. He says, “There is only one\n",
      "case, and that will be temporary, in which the accumulation of capital with a low price\n",
      "of food may be attended with a fall of profits; and that is, when the funds for the\n",
      "maintenance of labour increase much more rapidly than population;—wages will then\n",
      "be high and profits low. If every man were to forego the use of luxuries and be intent\n",
      "only on accumulation, a quantity of necessaries might be produced for which there\n",

      "might undoubtedly be an universal glut; and consequently there might neither be\n",

      "most completely to impugn the general principle. Even if we suppose with Mr.\n",
      "Ricardo, what is not true, that an increase of population would certainly remedy the\n",
      "evil; yet as from the nature of a population, an increase of labourers cannot be brought\n",

      "stimulus to the continued increase of wealth, it must always be recollected that a\n",
      "fertile soil gives at once the greatest natural capability of wealth that a country can\n",

      "intended to speak positively, but comparatively, that is with reference to its natural\n",
      "capabilities; and so understood, the proposition will be liable to few or no exceptions.\n",
      "Perhaps, indeed, it may be said that no instance has occurred, in modern times, of a\n",
      "large and very fertile country having made full use of its natural resources; while there\n",
      "have been many instances of small and unfertile states having accumulated within\n",

      "divided into large portions, and not favourably situated with respect to markets, a very\n",
      "long period might elapse before the state became wealthy and populous,\n",
      "notwithstanding the fertility of the soil and the consequent facility of production. The\n",
      "nature of such a soil would make it yield a profit or rent to the owner in its\n",
      "uncultivated state. He would set a value therefore upon his property, as a source of\n",
      "profit as well as of power and amusement; and though it was capable of yielding\n",
      "much more raw produce than he and his immediate dependents could consume, he\n",

      "tenants of these portions, if there were no foreign vent for the raw produce, and the\n",

      "known, would have but small incitement to call forth the resources of his land, and\n",
      "give encouragement to a rapid increase of population. By employing ten families he\n",
      "might perhaps, owing to the richness of the soil, obtain food for fifty; but he would\n",

      "he had wasted his time and attention in superintending the labour of so many persons.\n",

      "could be effected, would at once accomplish the object required, and create a quantity\n",

      "Of Inventions To Save Labour, Considered As A Stimulus To\n",
      "The Continued Increase Of Wealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inventions to save labour seldom take place to any considerable extent, except when\n",
      "there is a decided demand for them. They are the natural consequence of improvement\n",
      "and civilization, and, in their more perfect forms, generally come in aid of the failing\n",
      "powers of production on the land. The fertility of the soil, being a gift of nature, exists\n",
      "whether it is wanted or not; and must often therefore exceed for many hundred years\n",
      "the power of fully using it. Inventions, which substitute machinery for manual\n",
      "exertions, being the result of the ingenuity of man, and called forth by his wants, will,\n",
      "as might be expected, seldom exceed those wants.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the same law applies to both. They both come under the head of facilities of\n",
      "production; and in both cases a full use cannot be made of this facility, unless the\n",
      "power of supply which it furnishes be accompanied by an adequate extension of the\n",
      "market.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a machine is invented, which, by saving labour, will bring goods into the\n",
      "market at a much cheaper rate than before, the most usual effect is such an extension\n",
      "of the demand for the commodity, by its being brought within the power of a much\n",
      "greater number of purchasers, that the value of the whole mass of goods made by the\n",
      "new machinery greatly exceeds their former value; and, notwithstanding the saving of\n",
      "labour, more hands, instead of fewer, are required in the manufacture.\n",
      "\n",
      "This effect has been very strikingly exemplified in the cotton machinery of this\n",
      "country. The consumption of cotton goods has been so greatly extended both at home\n",
      "and abroad, on account of their cheapness, that the value of the whole of the cotton\n",
      "goods and twist now made exceeds, beyond comparison, their former value; while the\n",
      "rapidly increasing population of the towns of Manchester, Glasgow, &c. during the\n",
      "last thirty years, amply testifies that, with a few temporary exceptions, the demand for\n",
      "the labour concerned in the cotton manufactures, in spite of the machinery used, has\n",
      "been increasing very greatly.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the introduction of machinery has this effect, it is not easy to appreciate its\n",
      "enriching power, or its tendency to increase both the value and quantity of domestic\n",
      "and foreign commodities.\n",
      "\n",
      "When however the commodity to which machinery is applied is not of such a nature\n",
      "that its consumption can extend with its cheapness, the increase of wealth derived\n",
      "from it is neither so great nor so certain. Still however it may be highly beneficial; but\n",
      "the extent of this benefit* depends upon circumstances. Let us suppose a number of\n",
      "capitalists in the habit of employing £20,000 each for labour, in a manufacture of\n",
      "limited consumption, and that machines were introduced which, by the saving of\n",

      "labour, would enable them to supply the actual demand for the commodity with\n",
      "capitals of ten thousand pounds each in the purchase of labour, instead of twenty.\n",
      "There would, in this case, be a certain number of ten thousand pounds, and the men\n",
      "employed by these capitals, thrown out of employment. On the other hand, there\n",
      "would be a portion of revenue set free for the purchase of fresh commodities; and this\n",
      "demand would undoubtedly be of the greatest advantage in encouraging the\n",
      "employment of the vacant capitals in other directions. At the same time it must be\n",
      "recollected that this demand would not be a new one, and, even when fully supplied,\n",
      "could only replace the diminution of capital and profits in one department, occasioned\n",
      "by the employment of so many ten thousands, instead of twenty thousands. But in\n",
      "withdrawing capital, a part of which must necessarily be fixed, from one employment\n",
      "and placing it in another, there is almost always a considerable loss. The use-lessness\n",
      "of the old fixed capital would be at once a loss of revenue to the amount of the former\n",
      "interest and profits upon it. Even if the whole of the remainder could be immediately\n",
      "employed, it would probably be less in value: and on the whole, unless more menial\n",
      "servants were used, many persons would be thrown out of work; and thus the power\n",
      "of the whole capital and revenue to command the same quantity of labour would\n",
      "evidently depend upon the contingency of the vacant capitals being withdrawn\n",
      "undiminished from their old occupations, and finding immediately equivalent\n",
      "employment in others. But this assumed facility of finding immediate employment for\n",
      "fresh capital in new occupations with undiminished profits, appears to me to be\n",
      "contradicted by general experience; and the supposition here made must be allowed to\n",
      "present a case essentially distinct from that where, as in most of our great\n",
      "manufactures, the extension of demand, owing to the cheapness occasioned by\n",
      "machinery, has greatly increased the whole value as well as the whole quantity of the\n",

      "\n",
      "If, in order to try the principle, we were to push it farther, and to suppose that, without\n",
      "any extension of the foreign market for our goods, we could by means of machinery\n",
      "obtain all the commodities at present obtained at home, with one third of the labour\n",
      "now applied, is it in any degree probable that the mass of vacant capitals could be\n",
      "advantageously employed, or that the mass of labourers thrown out of work could find\n",
      "the means of commanding an adequate share of the national produce? If there were\n",
      "other foreign trades which, by means of the capital and labour thrown out of\n",
      "employment, might be greatly extended, the case would be at once quite altered, and\n",
      "the returns of such trades might furnish stimulants sufficient to keep up the value of\n",
      "the national income. But, if only an increase of domestic commodities could be\n",
      "obtained, there is every reason to fear that the exertions of industry would slacken.\n",
      "The peasant, who might be induced to labour an additional number of hours for tea or\n",
      "tobacco, might prefer indolence to a new coat. The tenant or small owner of land, who\n",
      "could obtain the common conveniences and luxuries of life at one third of their former\n",

      "something in the commodities to be obtained sufficiently desirable to balance this\n",
      "exertion, or the exertion will cease. And experience amply shews, by the number of\n",
      "persons who daily leave off business, when they might certainly have continued to\n",
      "improve their fortunes, that most men place some limits, however variable, to the\n",

      "\n",
      "Still however it is true that, when a great revenue has once been created in a country,\n",
      "in the shape of a large mass of rents, profits and wages, a considerable resistance will\n",
      "be made to any essential fall in its value. It is a very just remark of Hume,* that when\n",
      "the affairs of a society are brought to this situation; that is, when, by means of foreign\n",
      "trade, it has acquired the tastes necessary to give value to a great quantity of labour\n",
      "not employed upon actual necessaries, it may lose most of this trade, and yet continue\n",
      "great and powerful, on account of the extraordinary efforts which would be made by\n",
      "the spare capital and ingenuity of the country to refine home manufactures, in order to\n",
      "supply the tastes already formed, and the incomes already created. But if we were to\n",

      "Of this I think we shall be convinced, if, in our own country, we look at the quantity\n",

      "nature of the returns obtained for them. In the accounts of the year ended the 5th of\n",

      "Something else seems to be necessary in order to call these powers fully into action.\n",
      "This is an effectual and unchecked demand for all that is produced. And what appears\n",

      "relating to the distinction between wealth and value, it was observed, that where\n",
      "wealth and value are perhaps most nearly connected, is in the general necessity of the\n",
      "latter as a stimulus to the production of the former. Unless the estimation in which an\n",
      "object is held, or the value which an individual, or the society places on it when\n",
      "obtained, adequately compensates the sacrifice which has been made to obtain it, such\n",
      "wealth will not be produced in future.\n",

      "In individual cases, the power of producing particular commodities is called into\n",
      "action, in proportion to the intensity of effectual demand for them; and the greatest\n",
      "stimulus to their increase, independent of improved facilities of production, is a high\n",
      "market price, or an increase of their exchangeable value, before a greater value of\n",
      "capital has been employed upon them.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the same manner, the greatest stimulus to the continued production of commodities,\n",
      "taken altogether, is an increase in the exchangeable value of the whole mass, before a\n",
      "greater value of capital has been employed upon them.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been stated in a preceding section, that if all the roads and canals of the country\n",
      "were broken up, and the means of distributing its produce were essentially impeded,\n",
      "the whole value of the produce would greatly fall; indeed, it is obvious that if it were\n",
      "so distributed as not to be suited to the wants, tastes, and powers of the actual\n",
      "population in different situations, its value might sink to such a degree as to be\n",
      "comparatively quite inconsiderable. Upon the same principle, if the means of\n",
      "distributing the produce of the country were still further facilitated, and if the\n",

      "it, rose; and rose in a greater degree than the country produce fell in the London\n",

      "From the harvest of 1815 to the harvest of 1816, there cannot be a doubt that the funds\n",
      "for the maintenance of labour in this country were unusually abundant. Corn was\n",
      "particularly plentiful, and no other necessaries were deficient; yet it is an\n",
      "acknowledged fact, that great numbers were thrown out of employment, partly from\n",
      "the want of power, and partly from the want of will to employ the same quantity of\n",

      "the price at which he had before sold it, while the money price of labour had not\n",

      "additional goods to the amount perhaps of the whole fifty thousand pounds, and thus\n",
      "prevent any general fall in the value of the native produce consumed in the country,\n",

      "labourers, the demand, compared with the supply of material products, would\n",
      "prematurely fail, and the motive to further accumulation be checked, before it was\n",

      "In the fertility of the soil, in the powers of man to apply machinery as a substitute for\n",
      "labour, and in the motives to exertion under a system of private property, the laws of\n",
      "nature have provided for the leisure or personal services of a certain portion of\n",

      "the annuitants, as owners of fixed incomes, are most unjustly deprived of their proper\n",

      "among the labouring classes, I am most ready to allow. But it is a very different thing\n",

      "different manner.\n",

      "occasion great inconvenience to consumers, and great distress among the working\n",

      "apply it at all times, throughout all the variable periods which intervene between the\n",
      "first stage of cultivation and the last. Whenever capital increases too fast, the motive\n",
      "to accumulation diminishes, and there will be a natural tendency to spend more and\n",

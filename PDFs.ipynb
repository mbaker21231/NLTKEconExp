    "As I was fooling around with Ricardo's Principles of Economics and Smith's Wealth of Nations, I found that restricting myself to only plain text files was a bit of a handicap. So: how hard is it to wrangle text in other formats? Also, now that I am starting to get this up and running, it has been great that Jonathan (Conning) has offered a few comments here and there. \n",
    "\n",
    "Good question. I started by checking out [this web site](https://www.binpress.com/tutorial/manipulating-pdfs-with-python/167). This put me on the scent of the PDFminer package. This package will not work, because it is written in Python 2. An active fork, however, can be found at [this site](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pdfminer2). I ```pip install```ed this with no problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like almost all Python packages, there are some hiccups when it comes to actually getting them to work. Two that I encountered were that pdfminer requires cStringIO and chardet packages. (```pip install```ed them both)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's see how it works. First, I should mention that I tried using a wrapper for all of this called slate, but couldn't get this working. Instead, I fumbled around stackoverflow, and found some resources on how to work with the pdfminer. This question [is here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26494211/extracting-text-from-a-pdf-file-using-pdfminer-in-python). The code there took a little modifying, mainly because differences in how StringIO works these days, but here it is:"
